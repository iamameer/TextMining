": Tea is a woody shrub with pale - dark green leaves under natural conditions reaching a height of 5-15 m. In cultivation it is usually trimmed to 1-2 m tall. It has a taproot or oblique root system. The taproot may reach 3 m deep, but 1.5 is the usual. Development of lateral roots depends on environmental conditions. The trunk is straight, monopodial and the bark brown to grey. When a dormant bud develops it produces 1 or 2 small non-serrated bracts 5-10 mm long, which drop shortly. Then 1-2 pre-leaves appear 7-30 mm long without serrations or prominent veins. Then, normally, 4-8 true leaves appear followed by a new dormant bud. The true leaves are persistent, alternate with short pedicels 5-10 mm long. The lamina is elliptical to lanceolate and 7-22 cm long and 3-8 wide. It is sharply acuminate at the apex and cuneiform at the base. All leaf types, whether pubescent or glabrous, tender or leathery, are glossy and very green. The China differs from the Assam variety in its leaf characteristic which is coreacious and smaller; 4-10 cm long and about 1.5 cm wide. Flowers are pedicellate and develop from leaf axils on young branches and are either solitary or in clusters of 2-3. The pedicel is 8-10 mm long, glabrous (sometimes villous) with 2-3 caducous, broad, rounded and ciliate bracts. There are 5-6 green sepals which are herbaceous and slightly membraneous, 3-5 mm long, glabrous to villous and continue up to the fruit. The white corulla has 7-8 petals attached to the base of the androecium, they have more than 200 stamens 8-13 mm long with yellow anthers. The 8-12 mm-long gynaeceum with a superior ovary is very pubescent. Tea is practically allogamous and pollination is by insects and wind. Fruits are capsules with loculicidal dehiscence and are 1-1.5 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter with 1 to even 5 loculi, each with 2 seeds. Seeds are spherical to hemispherical, 0.8-1.6 cm in diameter and smooth and brown when mature. The endosperm has 2 cotyledons surrounding the embryo, the seed wall is hard and thick and adheres to an internal tegument which is thick, tough and shiny. There are 400-600 seeds to the kilo. USES: Camelia sinensis has been known for thousands of years and is one of today's most important beverages, cultivated on the 5 continents; cultivated first by the Chinese over 3000 years ago and introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 17th century. Depending on whether the leaves undergo fermentation the tea is black or green. Green leaves are steamed and dried to produce green tea or leaves are withered, fermented, and dried to provide black tea. It has a stimulant effect due to caffeine. Steam distillation of black tea yields an essential oil. Tea extract is used as a flavour in alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods, gelatins, and puddings. Air-dried tea seed yields a clear golden-yellow oil resembling sasanqua oil, but the seed cake, containing saponin, is not suitable for fodder. Refined tea seed oil, made by removing the free fatty acids with caustic soda, then bleaching the oil with Fuller's earth and a sprinkling of bone black, makes an oil suitable for use in manufacture of oil for burning purposes, and in all respects is considered a favourable substitute for rapeseed, olive, or lard oils. The oil is different from cottonseed, corn, or sesame oils in that it is a non-drying oil and is not subject to oxidation changes, thus making it very suitable for use in the textile industry; it remains liquid below -18o.C. Tea is a potential source of food colours (black, green, orange, yellow, etc.). KILLING T.: 0 to -5°C depending on the cultivar, var. sinensis withstands -5°C, whereas the leaves of var. assamica are killed by 0°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Harvest of leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a maximum at 7-10 years. The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes 270-360 days to mature and seeds are normally produced after 4-5 years. The economic life of the plant is about 40 years, but sometimes the shrubs are kept in production 60-70, or even 100 years. COMMON NAMES: Tea, The, Te, Tee, Tsa. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: C. thea, C. theifera, Thea sinensis, T. bohea, T. viridis. Tea can be grown in subtropical lowland and up to about 1800 m or even 2400-3000 m in the tropics, but the majority of the production takes place between 750 and 1500 m. Tea originates in the mountains of Southeast Asia, it is now grown between 40°N and 33°S. Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are beneficial. To low and too high humidity can reduce yields and encourage disease. Harvesting: Terminal sprouts with 2-3 leaves are usually hand-plucked, 10 kg of green shoots (75-80% water) produce about 2.5 kg of dried tea. Bushes are plucked every 7-15 days, depending on the development of the tender shoots. One ton of tea removes 45-60 kg N, 4-7 kg P and 20-30 kg K from the field.

": An unbranched, evergreen palm, reaching a height of 18-30 m with a stout trunk, up to 22-75 cm in diameter, covered with persistent leaf bases. The tree has adventitious roots growing from the bottom one meter of the trunk, and a few deeply penetrating roots that anchor the tree, but most of the roots grow horizontally in the top one meter of the soil, and as far away as 20 m from the bole. The stem terminates in a crown of leaves at the very top, 70-100 leaves, up to 7.5 m long, are produced in spiral succession from the apical meristem. The inflorescences are compound spikes, one borne in the axil of each leaf. The palm is monoecious and male and female flowers do not appear on the plant at the same time. Cross-pollination therefore almost always occurs. After fertilization, the female inflorescence develops into the fruit bunch. Each bunch may contain about 200 fruits. A single bunch may weigh 18-25 kg, of which 60-65% is fruit. The fruits are fibrous drupes about 4 cm long and 2 cm broad, with a pointed apex and a leathery, fairly thin exocarp surrounding the fleshy mesocarp, a hard endocarp and a seed. USES: Palm oil has saturated palmitic acids, as well as oleic and linoleic acids. It can be used in the manufacture of soap and candles and in the tin plate industry. It is the most productive species for bio-diesel. It contains vitamins A and E. Palm kernel oil is very similar to coconut oil and is used in edible fats, in the preparation of ice cream and mayonnaise, and in the manufacture of soaps and detergents. By tapping the male inflorescence, a wine can be made and the central shoot or cabbage of the palm is edible. The press cake from palm kernel oil can be used for animal feed. KILLING T.: 0oC at during rest or at early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: Elaeis belongs to the palm subfamily Cocoideae. African oil palm is indigenous to the humid tropics of West Africa. It occurs wild along the banks of rivers and streams in the transition zone between rain forest and open savanna, at latitudes between 3°N and 7°S. The cultivation is essentially limited to regions between 10°N and S. It can be found up to 1300 m in elevation near the equator. For commercial production altitudes above 500-700 m were considered unsuitable, but cold tolerance has extended this to 1500m. Growth rate is significantly affected below 20oC and there is no growth below 15oC. However, yields should not be significantly affected if the temperature drops below 20oC for a few hours at night only. With cold tolerance it can withstand temperatures of 12oC. It can tolerate temporary flooding, provided the water is not stagnant. Photosynthesis pathway C3II. Relative humidity should be higher than 75% in areas of commercial production and rainfall should be evenly distributed throughout the year. It requires adequate light and at least five hours of sunshine per day in all months of the year is desirable. Seedling growth stops at temperatures below 15oC. High winds can be harmful.
CULTIVATION AND POST HARVEST TREATMENT:
CROPPING SYSTEM: Oil palm can be a useful agroforestry species. On smallholdings oil palms are often intercropped with food crops such as maize, millet, cassava, cocoyams, groundnuts or bananas. This can be done for up to three years. On larger plantations, soil cover crops of legumes and grasses are often used. PROPAGATION: The plant is propagated from seed, that, however, germinate irregular and very slowly. To hasten the process, the moistened seeds can be mixed with charcoal and put in small boxes and then into polythene bags. These are laid in so called ""germinators"" for about 40 days at 38-40°C in low relative humidity. Then the seeds are allowed to absorb water and are held at 28-30°C for another 10-40 days. Seeds can also be germinated at the above temperature but without bags, then they should be watered every three days. A wet sack on the floor can help to keep the atmosphere damp. About 80% of the fresh seeds and 50-60% of stored seeds will germinate, but not at the same time and each week the germinated seeds should be removed. PRE-NURSERY: The germinated seeds are fragile and should therefore first be planted in prepared beds, trays, baskets or bags before being transferred to the field nursery. Soils for the pre-nursery should be well-drained, friable, fertile topsoil. The beds should be 20-23 cm high and not more than 120 cm wide. The trays 120 x 60 cm and 15-20 cm deep, while the baskets and polythene bags should be 23 cm deep and 10-15 cm in diameter. The sprouted seeds are planted carefully at a distance of 7.5 x 7.5 cm, their delicate roots pointing downwards and covered with 2.5 cm of soil. After 4-6 months, when the seedlings reach the 4-5 leaf stage, they are transferred to the field nursery FIELD-NURSERY: Here the seedlings are planted at a distance of 75-90 cm apart or in large polythene bags. They remain in the nursery 6-12 months before being transplanted to the field. The nursery area should be flat and near a water source. The soil should be as in the pre-nursery and organic manure should be incorporated before planting. FIELD: Seedlings should be between 10-18 months when they are transplanted to the field. It is best to move the seedlings with a substantial ball of earth (35-45 cm in diameter around their roots). When bare-root planting is necessary the roots should be dipped in a clay slurry as soon as they are lifted. Some leaf pruning may be necessary to reduce the seedlings height to about 1.2 m. The optimum planting density is about 123-140 palms per ha, which is the same as a planting distance of 8-9x9 m. New compact hybrids developed by ASD Costa Rica allow up to 170 palms per ha with corresponding yield increases due to the compact canopy; harvesting is also simplified due to their lower height. In areas with seasonal rainfall the transplanting should be done at the beginning of the rain, while in areas with a better rainfall distribution it can be done year round. LAND PREPARATION: The area around the planting holes should be cleared of all vegetation to a radius of 1 m. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.

Specimens have been known to live 200 years. The inflorescence develops in the apical bud for two years. After pollination fruit takes 150-180 days to mature. The tree requires a growing period of at least 270 days per year, the optimum is more than 300 days and the tree can grow throughout the year. FERTILIZATION: One ton of fruit removes about 6 kg N, 1 kg P, 8 kg K, 0.8 kg Ca and 0.6 kg Mg from the field. Typical fertilizer recommendations in West Africa would be: 114 g of N, P2O5, K2O and Mg in 1:1:1:2 per seedling in the nursery, 15 kg N, 24 kg K2O, 4 kg Mg per hectare at transplantation, 15 kg N, 45 kg K2O, 7 kg Mg per hectare in the first year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 60 kg K2O, 10 kg Mg per hectare in the second year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 75 kg K2O, 17 kg Mg per hectare in all subsequent years. The fertilizer should be applied in a ring 7.5-15 cm from the seedlings and about 1.5 meter from the mature palm. IRRIGATION: Required in the early stages and later during dry periods. WEED CONTROL: An area around each palm and a passage between the palms should be kept free of vegetation. For mature palms the vegetation free area should be about 2.5 m in diameter. PEST AND DISEASES: With good care and careful selection of plants, disease control in the stand is not usually necessary. Where there is danger from rodents young plants should be protected by a wire collar. The principal diseases of oil palm are blast, freckle and anthracnose. Common pests are palm weevils, leaf miners, slug caterpillars, but also rats, porcupines, wild pigs, elephants and palm-nut vulture can damage the palms. HARVESTING: The fruit bunches are cut off or knocked down when the fruit is ripe. The correct time for harvesting is in most cultivars indicated by the change in colour from black to orange or by the fall of the first individual fruits. Usually only one bunch on the tree ripens at a time. The ripe bunches should be cut very carefully to avoid damage to the subtending leaf. YIELDS: It produces the two distinct oils, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is obtained from the fleshy, orange mesocarp of the fruit, which contains 45-55 % oil, and palm kernel oil is obtained from the kernel or endosperm which contains about 50% oil. The best plantations yield about 30 t/ha of fruit per year. From that, about 7 tons of palm oil and 0.8 tons of kernel oil can be extracted. Oil palms can give a higher yield of oil per unit area than any other crop. In older plantations the yields are however often only about 3.5 tons oil per ha. per year.

USES: Pigeon pea is one of the most important grain legume components of subsistence farming systems in the semi-arid tropics. Plants are mainly grown for grain, green vegetables, and fodder. The young green seeds are eaten as vegetables and the ripe dry seeds as a pulse. The plant is also a good source of vitamin A. Ripe dry seeds can be split and made into dhal. Leaves, dried husks, seeds, and broken dhal are fed to cattle. For cut forage, it should be topped at a height of about 0.8 m. Under grazing conditions, it makes vigorous growth during the first year and then declines and ordinarily requires replanting every four to five years. The crop has long been used as a windbreak and shade for young coffee trees, forest seedling nurseries and vegetable beds, and is an important honey-producing plant. Leaves can also be fed to silkworms and lac insects and be used as green manure. It is planted as windbreaks and on contour for erosion control. It provides firewood and charcoal. Dried stalks serve for fuel, thatch and basketry. Pigeon pea is a legume, nodulated by Rhizobia of the cowpea group and is useful in rotational, alley or inter-cropping systems; providing nitrogen to the soil. KILLING T.: Does not tolerate frost, but will grow in temperatures to just above frost level. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, often grown as a warm-season annual. Growing period is 90-180 days for annual-production, and 130-365 days per year for perennials. Most varieties can mature and produce seeds in 100-300 days. When cultivated as a pulse crop, the plant is normally grown as an annual or biennial because production declines after the first year. When grown for forage or green manure it is usually maintained for no more than 5 years. The plant will die in about 10-12 years.

": Perennial. FURTHER INF.: It is native to humid and sub-tropic environments and is common along waterways or seashores, with its roots in fresh or saltwater. It is reported as native to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand and exotic in Australia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tonga and the United States of America. It occurs naturally in lowland forest on limestone and rocky coral outcrops on the coast, along the edges of mangrove forest and along tidal streams and rivers. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 1200 m. In its natural habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost and temperatures of up to 50°C. Reported temperature range for growth is 10-50°C with the optimum between 16-38°C. It is drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. Reported annual rainfall range for growth is 400-2500 mm with the optimum between 500-2000 mm. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of 2-6 months. It is a shade bearer and can grow under the shade of other trees, it is, however, not a shade demander and grows well even with full overhead light. It is well adapted to adverse soil moisture conditions and waterlogging. It can grow on most soil types but best growth is found on deep well-drained sandy loams with assured moisture, it will however also grow on sandy soils and heavy swelling clay soils. It does not do well on dry sands. It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity. Reported soil pH range for growth is 6-9 with the optimum between 6.5-8.5. Nodulation is reported on pongam. In nurseries and fields the presence of nodules on un-inoculated pongam seedlings is common. Therefore, this species may not be specific in its Rhizobium strain requirement. It nodulates and fixes atmospheric nitrogen with Rhizobium of the cowpea group.
Propagation methods: Natural reproduction is profuse by seed and common by root suckers. Spontaneous seedlings and root suckers are produced and may cause serious weed problems. Direct sowing is common and most successful. Seeds require no pre-treatment and germinate within 7 days to 1 month of sowing. Germination is hypogeal and the radicle develops quickly before the plumule emerges. In the nursery, it can be planted at a close spacing, as young plants tolerate shade well; in India a spacing of 7.5 x 15 cm is recommended. Seedlings attain a height of 25-30 cm in their first growing season. Transplanting to the field should occur at the beginning of the next rainy season when seedlings are about 60 cm in height. Seedlings have large root systems and soil should be retained around the roots during transplanting. Easily established by direct seeding or by planting nursery-raised seedlings or stump cuttings of 1-2 cm root-collar diameter. Propagation by branch cuttings and root suckers is also possible.
Tree Management: Seedling survival and growth benefit from annual weed control for the first 3 years after transplanting. Growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months was recorded in India. Trees coppice well and can also be pollarded. When planted as a shade or ornamental tree, pruning may be necessary to obtain a trunk of appropriate height. The spacing adopted in avenue planting is about 8 m between plants. In block plantings, the spacing can range from 2 x 2 m to 5 x 5 m. Individual trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually, (8-24 kg of seeds). The lateral spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely.

Before the production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90 cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135 cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad, strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions, the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc. The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between 16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to 159,000/kg for grass sorghum).",Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae,,,": The versatility of sweet sorghum resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the ""Four F's Crop"" for sweet sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference. The ""Four Fs"" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum, namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D; has concentrated on maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties, whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction of R&D; towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes, and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine."
"Scientific synonym: D. acuminatissima. Durian is a native of south-eastern Asia, particularly Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. It is strictly tropical and can be grown within the latitudinal range 18°N-S. It performs best at elevations between sea level and 800 m. In Malaysia and Thailand it is usually grown below 300 m. It needs shade when young. The tree is adapted to warm and humid growing conditions but it can tolerate 2-3 dry months. Short relatively dry spells may stimulate flowering. A sheltered site is desirable to prevent branches laden with fruit from breaking in the wind. Heavy soils may lead to root rot.

": A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2 phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous. Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long; generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base, pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals 5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile, alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube. Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong; sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with 10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons. The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting, marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean, with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits, chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with Panicum maximum and Centrosema pubescens. Fuel: The cocoa bean testa has a calorific value of 16 000-19 000 BTU/kg, a little higher than that for wood. Lipids: The ash from pod husks contains potassium oxide, which can be extracted in the form of potassium hydroxide, a useful alkaline in the saponification process. Cocoa-bean fat from unfermented cocoa beans can be extracted and used in soap making. Alcohol: The cocoa-pod husk can be hydrolysed under pressure for fermentation into alcoholic drinks. Medicine: Cacao butter can be used in cosmetics and has medical properties. The rural people in Amazonas State, Brazil, rub cocoa butter on bruises. Soil improver: There is considerable nutrient cycling through the development of a deep leaf litter under the cocoa canopy. Intercropping: Cocoa has traditionally been established in thinned forest following logging and 1-3 years of food-crop production before the canopy closes. Crops such as maize, cocoyam, yams and plantain are commonly intercropped with cocoa in Ecuador, Jamaica and West Africa. KILLING T.: Temperatures of about 5oC, even for a short period, may damage cacao but it is grown in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where normal winter temperatures reach 4-6oC. The tree is damaged by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial tree, that begins fruiting after 3-5 years and bears well up to an age of 30-40 years, or even 60 years in the best soils before yields begin to decline. Fruit and seed require 180-300 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): kokoe, (English): cacao, chocolate tree, cocoa, Nicaraguan cocoa shade, (French): cacao, cacaotier, cacaoyer, (German): Kakaobaum, (Indonesian): coklat, (Khmer): kakaaw, (Malay): pokok coklat, (Sinhala): maikona gaha, (Spanish): cacao amarillo, cacao criollo, cacao forastero, (Tamil): kona maram, (Thai): kho kho. FURTHER INF.: The generic name comes from the Greek ?theos? (god), and ?broma? (food) and means the ?food of the gods?. In its natural habitat it is an under-storey plant of forest in the wet humid tropics. In most of the producing countries of America, Asia or Oceania, permanent shading is provided by specially-planted trees, most commonly Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, various Erythrinae or even Albizia species. Finally, other industrial crops are often used as permanent shading for the cocoa tree, the coconut palm in particular. Of other crops there have been several attempts to intercrop cocoa trees with rubber, oil palm, areca palm (Areca catechu) or even with nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). When planted at their normal density, all these plants produce too much shade for the cocoa trees, which develop as far as vegetation is concerned, but produce very few pods. Cacao originated in the Upper Amazon region in South America. It can be grown between 20°N and S, but the bulk of the crop is grown within 10°N and S, usually below 300 m in elevation but it can be found up to 700 m, and exceptionally up to 1500 m in equatorial regions. The photosynthesis pathway is C3. Cacao is best adapted to 75-86% relative humidity at 09.0 hours, and 51-72% at 15.0 hours, above this humidity level the risk of diseases is increased. Young seedlings have a shade requirement for optimal growth, but for the mature crop optimal yield can only be obtained under full sunlight. Situations where the temperature frequently falls below 18.8 C, or rises above 32.2 C are said to be unfavourable. Cacao is sensitive to strong winds. The amount of nutrients removed in the harvest is not very high if the fruit shells are brought back to the plantation and used as mulch. One ton of cacao beans remove about 20 kg N, 4 kg P, and 10 kg K from the field. Optimum yield of dry beans is more than 2.0 t/ha, while average yields in Africa vary between 0.2-1.0 t/ha. It takes 16-30 kg of pods to produce 1 kg of dry cacao. Cacao is naturally out-breeding, and various insects are associated with its pollination, the main ones being thrips, midges, ants and aphids. It has a complex system of self-incompatibility. After successful pollination, fertilization takes place within 36 hours; the sepals, petals and staminodes drop away and the stamens and pistil wither. The young pod, known as the cherelle, begins to develop by longitudinal elongation, followed by increase in width. The period between fertilization and pod maturation varies from 150 to 180 days, depending on the variety. The pod turns light yellow when ripe and is ready for harvesting at this stage. Fermented seeds are roasted, cracked and ground to give a powdery mass from which fat is expressed. Cacao has the distinction of being a birthplace of IPM and over the last 30 years cocoa has increasingly become a smallholder cash crop.

": A globose evergreen, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree attaining heights of up to 5-10 m (when not pruned). The root system of the mature coffee tree consists of: a taproot, which is often extensively branched, robust, and generally short (0.3 to 0.5 m), but may grow as long as 1.0 m in deep soils. A number of secondary roots develop from the taproot and grow vertically downwards. The lighter and more penetrable the soil, the deeper they will develop. Their role, together with that of the taproot, is to assist in anchorage and supplying water to the plant. Lateral roots, which are generally numerous, develop, often almost horizontally, and are further extended by a network of rootlets. They explore the superficial and richest layers of the soil. Their role is essentially to provide mineral nutrition to the plant. Its branches are opposite, long, flexible, and rather thin; its habit is semi-erect when young and spreading or pendulous when adult. The petiolate leaves are dark glossy green, simple, opposite, acuminate; having a short petiole with undulating margins and a slightly crinkled surface, they are 10-15 cm long and 4-6 cm wide, sometimes bearing interpetiolar stipules. They have a prominent leaf midrib and lateral veins. Flowers produced in dense clusters along reproductive branches in the axils of the leaves. White, sweet scented, star-shaped and carried on stout but short peduncles. Bracteoles united, forming a cup-shaped epicalyx at the base of the flower. There are 5 calyx segments halfway the length, spreading out very widely at the anthesis and 5 stamens inserted in the corolla tube. Anthers carried on long, slender, upright filaments. It is about 90% autogamous (self-fertile) thus a great number of its flowers are fertilised before anthesis. Ovary inferior, 2 united unilocular carpels, each containing a single ovule attached to the base of the carpel wall. The ovary bears a slender style, which terminates in short, pointed bifid stigmas. The ovary is in the form of a drupe, and is commonly called a cherry. The cherry is ovoid or sub-globulous, red when ripe, 10-15 mm wide and 16-18 mm long, and consists of a coloured exocarp (skin), a fleshy, yellowish-white mesocarp (pulp) and two beans or seeds (8.5-12.5 mm long, ellipsoidal in shape and pressed together by flattened surface that is deeply grooved; outer surface convex) joined together along their flat sides. When one of the two ovaries aborts, the other develops into an ovoid bean, which is commercially known as a 'peaberry'. Each bean is protected by two coats. The first, the endocarp, is thin with a fibrous texture (parchment) and the second, the perisperm, is a very fine membrane (skin or silverskin) that more or less adheres to the bean. The size and shape of the beans differ depending on variety, environmental conditions, and cropping practices. On average, they are 10 mm long, 6-7 mm wide and 3-4 mm thick. They weigh 0.15-0.20 g. Dried seeds, after removal of the silvery skin, provide the coffee beans of commerce. The optimum temperature for the germination of coffee seeds is about 30°-32°C, below 10°C germination is very slow. USES: Food: Dried seeds (?beans?) are roasted, ground, and brewed to make 1 of the 2 most popular beverages in the world. In its native Ethiopia, it has been used as a masticatory since ancient times. Cooked in butter, it can be used to make rich flat cakes. Coffee is widely used as flavouring in ice cream, pastries, candies, and liqueurs. In Arabia, a fermented drink from the pulp is consumed. Fodder: Pulp and parchment are occasionally fed to cattle in India. Apiculture: Honeybees collect nectar and pollen from the flowers. The honey is light with a characteristic flavour. Mixed coffee-orange honey is very highly valued. Timber: Wood is hard, dense, durable, takes a polish well, and is suitable for tables, chairs and turnery. The bark can be made into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch. Soil improver: The pulp and parchment are used as manure and mulches. Annual litter fall from both shade and crop trees, including pruning residues, maintain soil organic matter levels and hence the cation exchange capacity; this reduces the risk of leaching losses and permits a more efficient use of any inorganic fertilizers applied. Intercropping: C. Arabica is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans or rice, during the 1st few years. Poison: C. Arabica seeds contain caffeine, which has been described as a natural herbicide, selectively inhibiting germination of seeds of Amaranthus spinosus. Medicine: Reported to be analgesic, an aphrodisiac, anorexic, antidotal, cardiotonic, CNS-stimulant, counterirritant, diuretic, hypnotic, lactagogue and nervine. Coffee is a folk remedy for asthma, tropine poisoning, fever, flu, headache, jaundice, malaria, migraine, narcosis, nephrosis, opium poisoning, sores and vertigo. Other products: Coffelite, a type of plastic, is made from coffee beans. Coffee with iodine is used as a deodorant. KILLING T.: Some varieties have been reported to withstand -4°C. Temperatures at -5- -8°C may kill the plant within an hour or two. At temperatures from 0-2°C, which are not unusual in some production areas, the foliar tissue and green shoots are killed. This is manifested by almost complete defoliation of the shrubs, the drying out of the young branches (black tip), and with an appreciable loss in the harvest. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to bear in 2-3 years, is in full bearing at 6-8 years, and produces economic yields for 30-40 years on average, though in some cases only 10-15 years, and in others up to 50-70 years. Plants of 80-100 years are known. Fruits mature 210-270 days after flowering, and the growth cycle is 240-330 days.

FURTHER INF.: The generic name Coffea arabica is derived from the Arabic word used for the drink, which, despite its name, may have come from the region of Kefa in Ethiopia; it is indigenous to the wet highland forests of Ethiopia. It can in equatorial regions be grown at elevations from 1300 to 2800 m, with 1500-1900 being usual, at 15°N or S it can be grown down to about 500 m. In the subtropics it is grown from sea level to 1000 m. The latitudinal range is between 22°N and 27°S. With too much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Medium humidity is best, periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial but arabica require 2-3 drier months for the initiation of flower buds. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3.
Processing: The ripe fruits of coffee are normally processed in the production area. They go through a certain number of operations, the objectives of which are to extract the beans from their covering of pulp, mucilage, parchment and film, and to improve their appearance. Two techniques are used to obtain clean coffee beans: Wet processing in which the fresh fruit is processed in three stages: a) Removal of the pulp and mucilage and washing, b) Drying of parchment coffee, c) Removal of the inner coverings, parchment, and film (hulling). Dry processing which consists of two stages: Drying of the fruit (coffee berries or cherry coffee), and b) Removal of the dried coverings in a single mechanical operation (hulling). Optimum yield of clean dry coffee beans is 2-3 t/ha obtained in Kenya, while average yields are about 0.5 t/ha in Brazil and 0.9 t/ha in Africa. An important disease in coffee is leaf rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix, it is most serious at low altitudes and when trees are weakened by overbearing.

GROWING PERIOD
Perennial deciduous tree.",
": The coconut is an evergreen palm, in strict botanical terms it is not a tree. It has no bark, branches, cambium or secondary growth. It is a woody, perennial monocotyledon and its trunk is a stem, which grows to about 25 m and exceptionally 30m; dwarf selections also exist. Being a monocotyledon the coconut has no taproot and adventitious roots develop continually from the bole. Roots may spread from the bole in any direction and at any angle below the horizontal for up to 10 m or more, depending on soil and water supply. The m ain roots are about 10mm in diameter with secondary and tertiary branches. When young they are coloured white to cream and have a very sharp tipped growing point below a loose root cap about 12mm long. There are no root hairs. The rate of elongation is not uniform and the root takes on a banded appearance as it matures and its colour darkens through shades of orange. When growth eventually ceases the root is brown with a tip that is rounded and blunt. The smallest branches are about 1-2mm in diameter and are short lived and frequently replaced. Where they occur at, or in wet conditions sometimes above, ground level the secondary and tertiary roots remain as very small, peg-like pneumatophores, or ""breathing roots"". It has a smooth, columnar, light grey-brown trunk, with a mean diameter of 30-40 cm at breast height, and topped with a terminal crown of leaves. Trunk slender and slightly swollen at the base, usually erect but may be leaning or curved and marked with leaf scars.. Leaves pinnate, polymorphic, feather shaped, 4-7m long and 1-1.5 m wide at the broadest part. Leaf stalks 1-2 cm in length and thornless. The inflorescence consists of female and male axillary flowers. Flowers small, light yellow, in clusters that emerge from canoe-shaped sheaths among the leaves. Male flowers small and more numerous. Female flowers fewer and occasionally completely absent; larger, spherical structures, about 25 mm in diameter. Fruit roughly ovoid, up to 15-25 cm long and composed of a thick, fibrous husk surrounding a somewhat spherical nut with a hard, brittle, hairy shell. The nut is 2-2.5 cm in diameter and 3-4 cm long. Three sunken holes of softer tissue, called ?eyes?, are at one end of the nut. Inside the shell is a thin, white, fleshy layer known as the ?meat?. The interior of the nut is hollow but partially filled with a watery liquid called ?coconut milk?. The meat is soft and jellylike when immature but becomes firm with maturity. Coconut milk is abundant in unripe fruit but is gradually absorbed as ripening proceeds. The fruits are green at first, turning brownish as they mature; yellow varieties go from yellow to brown. USES: Food: Copra, the dried coconut endosperm, contains an edible cooking oil (coconut oil). The apical region of C. nucifera (?millionaire salad?) is a food delicacy in areas where it is grown. Other food derivatives of coconut include coconut chips, coconut jam, coconut honey, coconut candy and other desserts. Fodder: Copra meal and coconut cake, the residues of oil extraction from copra containing approximately 20% protein, 45% carbohydrate, 11% fibre, fat, minerals and moisture, are used in cattle feed rations. Apiculture: C. nucifera is an important pollen source for honey production. Where sap is tapped from unopened inflorescences for toddy-making, many bees drain in the collecting pots. The honey may be greenish-yellow like the motor oil and crystal clear if monofloral. Granulation is medium (takes up to 3 months). Fuel: The high moisture content of C. nucifera wood and the difficulty of splitting it has made it relatively unpopular as firewood. Coconut shell charcoal is a major source of domestic fuel in the Philippines. It is also exported to Japan and the USA. Coconut oil can be used as a substitute for diesel oils, for electric generating plants and motor vehicles. Fibre: Three types of fibres are obtained from the coconut husks: mat fibre or yarn fibre, used in making mats; bristle fibre, used for brush making; and mattress fibre, used in stuffing mattresses and in upholstery. Leaflets are used in braiding mats, baskets and hats. Timber: C. nucifera timber has traditionally been used in tropical countries for the structural framework of houses. Coconut timber taken from the lower and middle parts of the trunk can be used for load-bearing structures in buildings, such as frames, floors and trusses. Coconut trunks can be used for poles, as they have great strength and flexibility. The wood can also be used for furniture and parquet flooring. Lipids: The oil contains fatty alcohol and glycerine used in soaps, detergents, shampoos cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and explosives. Alcohol: Sap from the tender, unopened inflorescence (coconut palm sap) is used in the producing areas for toddy, or tuba, a beverage obtained by natural fermentation. Tuba contains 6-7.5% alcohol. The distillation of fermented coconut toddy yields a spirit called arrack, produced commercially in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Other products: Coconut-shell flour, obtained from grinding clean, mature coconut shells to fine powder, is used as a filler in thermoplastic industry and an abrasive for cleaning machinery. Coconut-shell charcoal may be processed further into activated carbon that has many industrial applications, including general water purification, crystalline sugar preparation and gold purification. The edible mushrooms of the genus Auricularis grow well on coconut stems and are readily sold in China and elsewhere. Soil improver: Burnt husks form a useful sort of potash that is used to fertilize the trees. The husks also make valuable mulch for moisture conservation in the dry season and help to suppress weeds. Ornamental: Planted widely as an ornamental tree. Intercropping: Coconut palm is one of the most widely grown tree crops in the tropical countries. Its growth characteristics are ideal for small production and also for combining with other crops. The crown morphology and the relatively wide spacing facilitate the planting of a wide spectrum of field crops in coconut plantations. It has therefore been intercropped with cereals (cassava, sweet potatoes, yams) or fruits (bananas, passion fruit, pineapples and ground nuts) in many countries including Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines etc. KILLING T.: Will withstand a small amount of frost. The lowest temperatures tolerated for long periods are for palm 10°C, for leaves 15°C, and for flowers 20°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering begins at 5-7 years, (dwarf varieties 3.5-4.5 years). The palm reaches full bearing after 10-12 years, maturity at about 15 years and lives up to between 60 and 100 years in the wild state, and 50-70 years under cultivation. There is a 360-365 day yield cycle. The inflorescence is initiated 16 months before the spathe opens and the nut takes about a year to mature from the time of pollination.

Please see notes in the EcoPort link for hybrid names. FURTHER INF.: The coconut palm probably originated from the Melanesian region. It is generally grown within 26°N and S and the most suitable climates are found between 10°N and S. For good yields coconut requires small temperature differences between day and night, because of this it is normally grown no higher than 700-950 m above sea level even at the equator. It can though be found up to 1500 m in a few areas near the equator. Areas where drainage is poor are not satisfactory unless the water rises and falls frequently, as is the case near a tidal estuary. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Normally 84-97% relative humidity is required for good production, 63% is about the minimum for production and the monthly mean should not fall below 60%. It is popularly known as ?Tree of Life?, ?Tree of Heaven?, ?Kalpaviriksha?, ?Tree of Abundance?, ?Natures? Supermarket? and is grown in more than 93 countries in an area of 11.85 million ha with production of 10.39 million tonnes of copra equivalent. It sustains millions of small holders for their livelihood.

"In the tropics cucumber can be grown at altitudes up to 1200-1800 m, or probably considerably higher. Water requirements is high, but high humidity encourages diseases, particularly downy mildew. A high light intensity increases the number of male flowers, while lower light levels result in more female flowers being formed. Optimum night temperature range between 18-24°C.

"White jute is native to a region including India, Myanmar and sourthern China. It can be found in tropical lowland and perhaps also highland. It require a humid climate with a relative humidity between 60 and 90% in the growing period, but diurnal fluctuations of up to 50% are not a disadvantage. Young plants are sensitive to waterlogging, but more mature plants will tolerate flooding. White jute is often grown on areas that are inundated every year and enriched by deposits.

It can also be used for silage and as an energy substitute and is often considered a good candidate for bio-fuel, especially ethanol fuel production, due to its hardiness against poor soil and climate conditions, rapid growth and low fertilization and herbicide requirements. It has the potential to produce the biomass required for production of up to 380 liters of ethanol per metric ton. This gives it the potential to produce over 400 liters of ethanol per hectare, compared to 270 for sugarcane and 160 for corn. However, there is debate on the viability of switchgrass, and other bio-fuels, as an efficient energy source. University of California, Berkeley professor Tad Patzek argues that switchgrass has a negative ethanol fuel energy balance, requiring 45 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced."

Each well-grown tree yields 15 to 30 Kg nutlets equivalent to 2.5-5 kg oil and about the same quantity of oilcake. This amounts to 1000-2000 kg oil/ha/year and about the same quantity of oilcake. The oil is largely used in the preparation of bakery products in Central America. In India too it can be used in the manufacture of vanaspati, vegetable oil and/or margarine. The oil is free from bad cholesterol. It can be also used for industrial purposes in the manufacture of bio-fuels, soaps, detergents, lubricants, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc. The oilcake being rich in nitrogen (8%), phosphorus (1.1%) and potash (1.2%), is good organic manure. The shells can be used in the manufacture of particleboard, activated charcoal or as fuel. The fruit pulp, rich in sugars (about 11%) can be used in the preparation of beverages. The pulp and leaf litter can be economically used in the manufacture of vermicompost (about 8 tons/ha/year). The wood is generally insect resistant and is used in the preparation of furniture, toys, as pulp (in paper making) and as fuel. The flowers are a source of honey. The residual cake left after processing the crude fat from the seed contains a toxin. All parts of the tree are used for medicinal purposes. The bark is taken as a decoction or tea for diarrhoea and fever. Leaves are used for rheumatism or are applied in the form of a lotion for body pain, bruises or skin itch.
