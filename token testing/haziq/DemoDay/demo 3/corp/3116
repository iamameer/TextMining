   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous shrub or small tree reaching 0.3-6 m in
   height. It is an extremely variable species. In habit, it may range
   from a low and spreading to erect and slender shrub or small tree.
   Flowering abundantly in the spring, and very coloured in the fall. USE:
   Berries are eaten fresh or preserved, cooked into jelly and pastries.
   They are also used for stomach disorders and eye and eardrops. Root
   bark infusions used to prevent miscarriages. Bark uses include laxative
   and cathartic, ease of menstrual bleeding and pass the afterbirth,
   disinfectant and eyewash. It is grown in gardens as an ornamental, in
   orchards, and shelterbelts and also used for revegetation of disturbed
   lands. The shrub stabilizes loose, disturbed soils, especially erodable
   slopes. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Saskatoon, Juneberry.
   FURTHER INF: It is native of western North America. Ranging from
   Alaska, the Yukon and Northwest Territories (close to the Arctic
   Circle), and south to California, Arizona, and New Mexico.It is
   commonly found in open woods, forest edges, roadsides, coulees and
   bluffs, on hillsides, and along gulleys and stream banks. It is highly
   adaptable. Moisture appears to be the limiting factor in determining
   habitat. It never occurs in habitats receiving less than 340 mm of
   annual precipitation. The flower buds have been found to have the
   potential for extreme resistance to low temperature injury (-50 to
   -60°C) at maximum hardiness. However, the plant is still susceptible to
   damage from late-spring frosts in particular. The chilling requirements
   appear to be generally low, 400 to 600 hours at 0 to 7°C. Seedlings
   will not survive in full shade. It may persist in a forest understory
   for decades, but eventually it dies as canopy closes
