   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A grass with short rhizomes, slowly spreading,
   erect, producing a medium dense sod and reaching about 40-120 cm or
   even 170 cm in height. USES: Used for pasture, hay and silage. GROWING
   PERIOD: Cool-season perennial. COMMON NAMES: Meadow foxtail. FURTHER
   INF: It is native of temperate regions of Europe and Asia and has
   become subcosmopolitan in temperate regions. Widespread mainly in the
   lowlands. In the Alps, grows up to 1200 m. It has a wide climate range
   except in dry climates and is common in meadows and on waste land.
   Extremely resistant to cold and to long snowy periods. Tolerates shade,
   namely in old orchards. It is drought sensitive and has certain winter
   requirements. Thrives on cool and wet soils. Optimum on nutrient rich
   to very rich soils. Grows on slightly acid to alcaline soils.
   Widespread mainly on clay soils. Other types of soils can be suitable
   as far as they are wet and nutrient rich: alluvium, colluvium and peat
   soils.
