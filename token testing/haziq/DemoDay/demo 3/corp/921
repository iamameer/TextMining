   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A stoloniferous grass up to 60 cm tall with much
   branched culms, often decumbent and often rooting from the lower nodes,
   forming a dense, leafy mat. USES Palatable and nutritious, used for
   pasture and withstands heavy grazing. Extremely heavy grazing is not
   harmful if the grass afterwards is allowed to reach 30-45 cm in height.
   Also used for hay and silage and for erosion control. KILLING T It is
   susceptible to frosts, but it often recovers during subsequent warm
   weather. GROWING PERIOD Fast growing summer perennial grass. COMMON
   NAMES Pangola grass, Common finger grass, Pasto pangola, Pangola digit
   grass, Digit grass, Pongola grass. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: D.
   decumbens, D. smutsii, D. pentzii, D. valida, D. pentzii var.
   stolonifera, D. eriantha. Pangola grass is native of subtropical
   southern Africa. In the northern hemisphere it is usually found between
   21-30Â°N. It is best adapted to humid conditions and it makes best
   growth in coastal areas. In Hawaii, it can be found at elevations from
   sea level to 1500 m. It can withstand teporary flooding as well as
   drought. Dry matter yields are usually between 11-22 t/ha, but may be
   up to 36 t/ha. The grass does not produce fertile seed, but is
   extremely competitive, aggressive towards legumes and can become a
   weed.
