   of 6-15 m or exceptionally up to 30 m with a short bole and a spreading
   crown. The trunk can become 30-60 or even 80 cm in diameter, but tree
   with large dimensions are often hollow. It is often cultivated for its
   handsome clusters of pale purplish fragrant flowers. USES: The wood is

   turnery articles, and firewood. The leaves and fruit have insecticidal
   properties. Fruits, flowers, leaves, bark, and roots have medicinal
   properties. The berries are toxic to animals. An oil can be extracted

   of Asia and it is grown as an ornamental and shade tree. It is
   mentioned as a agroforestry species. KILLING T.: Young seedlings are
   frost tender. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial. Under good
   conditions it may grow up to 1.7 m in height per year and is often
   grown on short rotations, replacement often necessary after 20 years.
