   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Southernwood is an erect-growing shrub up to 2 m in
   height. The plant is characterized by its many branches, gray-green
   aromatic leaves, and rarely blooming yellow-white flowers. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial shrub. USE: It is valued as both an ornamental and
   aromatic plant. Although primarily grown as an ornamental, the plant
   has an essential or volatile oil containing absinthol. The
   lemon-scented leaves and flowers are sometimes used in herbal teas.
   Young shoots have been used to flavour pastries and puddings. Branches
   are used to produce a dye of deep yellow colour for use with wool. As a
   medicinal plant, it is traditionally considered an antiseptic,
   astringent, emmenagogue, febrifuge, stimulant, tonic, stomachic, and
   vermifuge. It has also been used against coughs, tumors, and cancers.
   Southernwood is thought to be an insect and moth repellent. COMMON
   NAMES: Southernwood, Lad's love, Southern wormwood. FURTHER INF: It is
   native to southern Europe.
