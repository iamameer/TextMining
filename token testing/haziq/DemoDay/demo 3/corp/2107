   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Herbaceous legume with taproot, initially prostrate but
   stems can ascend through taller grass to about 45 cm. Leaves
   trifoliolate, leaflets 0.4-2.4 cm long and 0.4-2 cm wide. Inflorescence
   more or less globose, about 2 cm across, comprising (4-) 20-( 40) white
   flowers. Pods, 5-6 mm long. USE: Used as an alternative to Trifolium
   repens in permanent pastures on more acid soils and in warmer
   environments. Provides good ground cover under more open tree canopies.
   KILLING T: It can resist moderate frosting but top growth is killed by
   heavy frosts. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial growing spring to autumn.
   COMMON NAMES: Kenya white clover. FURTHER INF: It is native of the
   highlands of East and Central Africa at latitudes between 13°N-15°S at
   elevations from 1000 to more than 3000 m. In subtropical Australia at
   25-31ºS it is grown at elevations between sea level and 700 m. It is
   well adapted to high relative air humidity and to annual rainfall
   between 450-2000 mm. It can survive lengthy dry periods but is not very
   tolerant of waterlogging. Found in areas with average annual
   temperatures from about 16-21ºC. Occurs on soil textures from sand
   through silt, loam and gravely clay loam to clay, with pH ranging from
   4.0-8.0. Dry matter yields may be up to 8.5 t/ha.
