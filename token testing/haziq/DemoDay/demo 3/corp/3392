   Ecocrop code 3392

   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a vigorous, aromatic, herbaceous plant reaching
   120-200 or even 300 cm in height and 100 cm in width. Gandular
   trichomes occur on leaves and especially inflorescences. Artemisinin is
   sequestered in these trichomes. USE: Artemisinin used in the treatment
   of malaria. Due to its aggressive fibrous root system it is used for
   erosion control on slopes. It also makes a graceful accent in the back
   of a flowerbed or a pretty quick screen and is used in fresh and dried
   arrangements. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or sometimes biennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Annual wormwood. FURTHER INF: It is native to Asia, the center
   of origin is most probably China; wild populations occur both in China
   and Vietnam. It thrives in many temperate to sub-tropical ecologies.
   The plant is un-adapted to the tropics because flowering will be
   induced when the plants are very small; with the possible exceptions of
   high altitude plateaus and/or regions with a pronounced cool period
   such as Vietnam where there are two months of low temperatures at the
   beginning of the season. It can be found on barnyards, farm lots,
   fallow fields, borders of woods, mudflats along streams and ponds,
   waste ground, roadsides, railroads, alleys of older cities and in
   cultivated beds. It has become a weed in many areas of the world. The
   critical photoperiod seems to be about 13.5 hours, but there are likely
   to be photoperiod x temperature interactions. Plants are more aromatic
   and long-lived when grown in a poor dry soil.
