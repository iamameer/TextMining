   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Aromatic tree to 30 m tall, but probably smaller in its
   elfin forest habitat; fruiting when only 6-12 m tall. Leaves aromatic,
   coriaceous, entire (possibly evergreen), thickest above the middle,
   pinnately nerved, with a short acumen at the tip. Flowers fragrant,
   white, clustered on the stems. Fruits average 25 mm in diameter (12-43
   mm). Each fruit has 5-72 seeds (average 31), the seeds ranging from
   1-40 mm, averaging 3 mm. The seeds are close to hexahedral and
   prismatic, being quite angular, black to blackish gold, often still
   surrounded by a gummy or resinous endocarp. USES: It is called
   petroleum nut because of the resemblance of the odour of the fruit's
   oil to that of petroleum, the fruits, even green ones, burn brilliantly
   when ignited. Hence they are used like torch nuts or candlenuts for
   illumination in the bush. The oleoresin is used to treat muscular pains
   and skin diseases and the nut decoction is used for colds. FURTHER
   INF.: Petroleum nut is reported to range from 600-2 400 m elevation. In
   the Philippines, it is locally known in Benguet as apisang, abkol,
   abkel, and langis; in the Mountain Province, dael and dingo, and in
   Abra, sagaga. It abounds in Mt. Pulis, Ifugao, and is reported from the
   headwaters of the Agno and Chico River Basins. Also in the Bicol
   Provinces, Palawan, Hindoro, Nueva Ecija, and Laguna Provinces. It is
   being cultivated at FORI's Conifer Research Center, Baguio City.
   Whether or not it can stand frost, dry heat, and drought is
   questionable. Seeds and cutting can be used to propagate the tree.
   Seeds may lose their vitality rather rapidly.
