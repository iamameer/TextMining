   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A spiny, much branched, evergreen, small tree, shrub or
   scrambler, up to 5 m in height, with a milky sap. Bark grey, smooth,
   young branchlets with or without hairs, spines simple, straight, 2-5 cm
   long, usually single. USE: The fruits are sweet, pleasant to eat and
   also made into jam. The tree is browsed by goats and camels. Wood is
   used as fuel. The roots, bark and leaves have medicinal properties.
   Roots contain an active ingredient, carissin, that may prove useful in
   the treatment of cancer. The tree is planted as an ornamental and the
   abundant branching habit and the presence of spines make the plant
   suitable for planting as a protective hedge. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   In southern Africa flowering occurs from September to December and
   fruiting from November to January. COMMON NAMES: Egyptian carissa.
   FURTHER INF: It is found in Arabia and reaches through Senegal to
   Cameroon and throughout the drier parts of tropical Africa to the
   Transvaal, Botswana and north and northeast Namibia. Also found across
   Asia to Indo-China. It is a tree of deciduous forest, coastal thickets,
   warm bush-land and scrub. It is often found growing on termite-mounds
   at elevations from 900 to 1300 m. In Uganda it is usually found in
   wooded grassland, especially in low-lying areas and also in thickets in
   woodlands, forest edges and secondary scrub. It prefers dryish
   conditions.
