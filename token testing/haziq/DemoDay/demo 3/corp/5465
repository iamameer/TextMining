   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen, semi-evergreen or deciduous tree or
   shrub up to 25 m, and 1.9 m girth. The bark is pelican in colour,
   exfoliating in rectangular scales. The primary root is long, thick and
   fleshy at first, afterwards woody, greyish, often swollen in upper part
   near ground level. Leaves opposite or alternate and coriaceus, up to 35
   cm long. USE: The fruits and powdered seeds are sold in local markets
   and eaten. Leaves are used as fodder and wood as timber and fuel. The
   seeds can be intoxicating; they have been prescribed in India as a cure
   for mental disorders, nervous breakdowns and palpitations of the heart.
   The fruits have a cooling and an astringent effect. Dried flowers are
   reportedly useful in urinary, skin and blood diseases. The bark is
   astringent; its decoction is used in diarrhoea. It is often found along
   field boundaries. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Tendu,
   Balai, Tumki. FURTHER INF: It is shade tolerant in youth but later it
   demands light. It is drought and frost hardy but sensitive to
   waterlogging. It is normally found in a dry deciduous forest. Common
   throughout India. It is a widely distributed and tolerant species
   regarding soil requirements. It grows on poor denuded soils, hot and
   dry hill slopes, stony soils with quartzite, shale and sandstone, and
   also heavy clays. It however attains best growth and development on
   loose, porous soils in cool and moist sheltered valleys where it tends
   to be gregarious.
