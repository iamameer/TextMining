   Notes
   It succeeds best in tropical and subtropical regions. It can be grown
   as a summer crop in temperate regions. The fruits will not ripen, but
   the herbage is usable.
   Latitude: It is a tropical and sub-tropical crop normally limited to
   latitudes between 35°N and 25°S.
   Altitude: Sea-level up to 900 m.
   Temperature: It is very sensitive to frost. Reported temperature range
   for growth is 10-36°Cwith the optimum between 16-32°C.
   Water: Reported annual rainfall range for growth is 500-3500 mm with
   the optimum between 1000-3000 mm. Some cultivars give satisfactory
   yields in wet humid regions although most are partially drought
   resistant. A relative air humidity of about 70-85% during the growing
   period is best. Tolerates a warmer and more humid climate than kenaf,
   but is more susceptible to damage from frost and fog. Where rainfall is
   inadequate, irrigation has given good results.
   Radiation
   Range & intensity: It thrives in full sun light and is not shade
   tolerant.
   Photoperiodism: It is a short-day plant and unlike kenaf, it cannot be
   grown successively throughout the year. It requires 12-12.5 hours
   day-length for flowering and fruit production. In United States plants
   do not flower until short days of late fall or early winter. If
   flowering is not necessary as for fibre production, long light days for
   3-4 months is the critical factor.
   Soil:
   Physical: It requires a permeable soil, a friable sandy loam with humus
   being preferable; however, it will adapt to a variety of soils. It will
   not tolerate floods or stagnant water.
   Chemical: Reported soil pH range for growth is 4.5-8.5 with the optimum
   between 5.5-7.5. It prefers a fertile to moderately fertile non-saline
   soil.
