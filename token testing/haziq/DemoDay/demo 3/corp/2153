   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous, prostrate, climbing, or sub-erect to
   erect legume, growing 15-80 cm high. Erect and bushy to prostrate and
   creeping growth habits exist depending on cultivar and growing
   conditions. Cowpeas develop strong root systems that have many
   spreading laterals in the surface soil. The stems have circular
   sections and are pock marked. They are sometimes slightly grooved and
   are glabrous. The texture is fibrous and hard, firm and not inflated
   when young. Leaves are alternate and trifoliolate and the leaflets are
   oval, pointed (6-15 cm x 4-11 cm). They are generally entire and
   sometimes lobed. Genotypes vary in the degree of pubescence, but all
   cultivated cowpeas are less glabrous than other legumes such as common
   bean and soybean. Stipules are spurred at the base, stipels are hardly
   visible. Inflorescence racemose, flowers white, cream, yellow, mauve or
   purple. Pods usually occur in pairs forming a V, and are non-dehiscent.
   Pod orientation is mostly pendant and vertical. Pod length ranges from
   6.5-25 cm and the width ranges from 3-12 mm. Under warm conditions, pod
   development is rapid and may take only two weeks from pollination to
   pod maturation. Each pod holds from 8 to 20 seeds in a crowded
   orientation. Seed length is between 6-11 mm and the width is from 4-9
   mm. The testa colour also varies from white, pinky-white, pink, tan,
   brown, and black. The hylum is often ringed black or brown, strongly
   contrasting with the shade of the testa and hence the name "blackeyed
   beans" of the Antilles. The testa is thick and of ellipsoid and more or
   less rounded form. Number of seeds per kg is from 4600 up to 16000.
   USES: Cowpea is one of the most important grain legumes in Africa and
   in parts of the Americas and Asia. In addition to its dry grain,
   fresh-shelled 'peas', fresh pods, and fresh and dried leaves and
   flowers are consumed in some regions. The plant is used as cut and
   carry forage, and for hay and silage. Cowpea forms highly effective
   associations with a wide range of native nitrogen fixing strains of
   Rhizobium bacteria and with mycorrhizae that allows the species to
   tolerate poor soils. Used as a green manure, it can be incorporated
   into the soil 8-10 weeks after sowing, and can provide the equivalent
   of 80 kg/ha N to a subsequent crop. KILLING T.: It is susceptible to
   frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Some cowpea accessions may start
   flowering 30 days after sowing and are ready for harvest of dry seeds
   25 days later; others may take more than 90 days to flower, and 210-240
   days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Cowpea, crowder pea, clack-eyed pea,
   couthern pea, atimbawini, boeme, boontjie, catjang, caupí, frijol de
   vaca, imbumba, isihlumaya. FURTHER INF.: It is native of West Africa
   and cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics between 40ºN and
   30ºS at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. Occurs in areas with
   annual rainfall between 400-2000 mm and summer temperatures between
   25-35°C. Found on a wide range of very acid (pH 4) to strongly alkaline
   also low-fertility soils from sands to heavy, well-drained clays, with
   a preference for lighter soils. It does not tolerate extended flooding
   or salinity. Most cowpea accessions exhibit classic short-day responses
   with respect to time of flowering, although a range of sensitivities
   occur and the effect is modulated by temperature. It is mainly
   autogamous and in most environments outcrossing is low (less than 5%),
   but in the presence of bumble bees or other large insects, out-crossing
   can be much higher. Flowers open early in the morning, close by noon
   and may fall off during the same day. The photoperiodism of many
   African landraces confers adaptation to a specific latitude and
   rainfall pattern such that flowering and pod development coincide with
   the end of the rainy season in a particular place ensuring that pods
   mature in dry weather thus avoiding pod rots and other diseases. The
   photosynthetic pathway is C3 and the leaves have full maximal rates of
   photosynthesis at full expansion. Vegetative DM production 3-10 t/ha in
   8-12 weeks; grain production 250-4000 kg/ha.
