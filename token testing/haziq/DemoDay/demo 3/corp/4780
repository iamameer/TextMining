   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a rambling shrub up to 0.5-4 m in height, or
   scandent to 8 m with recurved spines to 3 cm long. Leaves alternate or
   subopposite, elliptic or obovate, base cuneate, apex rounded to shortly
   acuminate, to 7 x 5 cm, more or less pubescent. USE: It provides browse
   for livestock in Senegal, Sudan and northern Kenya, where buck will
   also eat it. The lianous branches are supple and are used in Kenya to
   make donkey panniers and wicker baskets for holding milk vessels. In
   Senegal, they are a part of the construction of a fish lure. The plant
   has diuretic properties. Water in which the leaves have been boiled is
   drunk in northwest Senegal to promote micturition in cases when
   venereal disease obstructs the urethra. The plant is also purgative. It
   is prescribed for blennorrhoea, helminthiasis, and loss of appetite. It
   is also used in Burkina Faso and Senegal for leprosy. In Senegal, the
   Soce tribe claims that a root decoction has a well-established
   reputation in the treatment of catarrh, the Serer tribe uses sap from
   the centre of the stem for eye troubles. The boiled roots are taken in
   Kenya for stomach upsets. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Eddi
   shebai. FURTHER INF: It is found in dry savannah, thickets on dry soils
   and is sometimes riverine; recorded from Mauritania to nothern Nigeria
   and across Africa to northeast Africa. In southern Sudan, it is
   widespread in the Terminalia-Combretum belt.
