   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A bushy, rounded or spreading shrub, with many fine
   branches reaching a height of 1-5 m. USES It is eaten by cattle in some
   areas but probably not by sheep. The primary use of the species is for
   sand stabilisation and low windbreaks in arid areas. The seeds can be
   ground and eaten but undesirable side-effects have been observed.
   GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial. Withstands a dry season of 5-11
   months. COMMON NAMES
   Sandhill wattle, Sandhill acacia, Umbrella bush, Marpoo, Dune wattle,
   Little cooba, Small coobah. FURTHER INF Sandhill wattle occurs in
   almost all of central, southwestern and southern Australia within the
   latitudinal range 17-37Â°S at elevations between sea level and 700 m. It
   is common on sand dunes but also occur on flood and erosion plains,
   lower hill slopes, and on the lunettes fringing lakes. It ease of
   regeneration suggests it has the potential of becoming a weed under
   favourable conditions.
