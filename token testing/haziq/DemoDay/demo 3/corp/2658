   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A fast growing pioneer tree reaching a height of
   15-30 m and a trunk diameter of up to 90 cm. The bole may be clear for
   more than 1/2 of the tree height. On adverse sites, it may be reduced
   to a 7-10 m high shrub. USES The timber can be sawn easily and is easy
   to work, it is durable when exposed to the weather but not to the
   ground. It is suitable for furniture and cabinet-making and it is a
   good fuel. Leaves can be used as fodder and the tree makes a good
   shade, screening and soil-cover crop. KILLING T It will survive light
   frost. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial tree, can reach up to 23 m
   in only 9 years. The time between flowering and seed maturity is
   180-210 days. COMMON NAMES Mangium, Brown salwood, Black wattle,
   Hickory wattle, Sabah salwood, Maber. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms:
   A. glaucescens, Mangium montanum. Mangium is indigenous to northeastern
   Australia, Papua New Guinea, and eastern Indonesia. It can be found
   naturally within the latitudinal range of 1-18Â°S and can be found at
   elevations between sea level and 800 m, but is most common below 400 m.
   It occur naturally at the edges of mangrove stands, in the transition
   area between forests and rivers and grassland, and in areas recently
   disturbed, especially by fire. It is mentioned as a possible
   agroforestry species. It fixes nitrogen and it can regenerate rapidly.
   There is a possibility that the tree could become a weed, especially if
   poor provenances are introduced and the tree has become a weed in
   Sabah. The tree may suffer from heart rot in to humid areas. Young
   trees are killed by fire, while older trees are more resistant but may
   be killed by very hot fires. Yearly volume production may be 20-30
   m3/ha.
