   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a very attractive dense evergreen shrub or a small
   tree that grows up to 4,5 m high. The leaves are light green when young
   and very dark and shiny when mature. They are simple and alternate or
   sometimes nearly opposite; 2,5 - 8 cm long. The fruits are about the
   size of a pea, round and clearly divided into three compartments. They
   are fleshy and green, turning red and then purple as they ripen. USE:
   The fruits are edible. A decoction of the root is taken as a blood
   purifier, to treat pneumonia, gonorrhoea rheumatism and stomach-ache
   and as a gargle. The leaves are applied as a liniment to simple
   sprains. Leaf decoction may be mixed with the bark of Erythrina
   abyssinica to alleviate colic. The tree is used for erosion control,
   shade, shelter, low wind break, as a living fence and as an ornamental.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Dogwood. FURTHER INF: It is
   widespread and locally common at medium to high altitudes, along water
   courses, in riverine forest and at the margins of evergreen forests. It
   grows in mountain forests, especially in clearings and along edges and
   also in secondary, mountain evergreen forests and mountain slopes,
   frequently among rocks. It stretches from South Africa northwards
   through tropical Africa to Ethiopia. The tree casts so deep a shade
   that it often prevents other growth around it. It can withstand a fair
   amount of frost and grows well in light shade under trees and equally
   well in full sun. It grows readily in most soils, but thrives in moist,
   humus-rich soils.
