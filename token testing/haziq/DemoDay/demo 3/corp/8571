   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Norway spruce is an evergreen tree reaching a height of
   30-60 m. The bole is usually straight and symmetrical, with no tendency
   to fork. The root system is typically shallow, with several lateral
   roots and no taproot. On rocky sites the roots spread widely, twining
   over the rocks. On bog soils, it tends to form plate-like roots. USE:
   The wood is strong, soft, straight- and fine-grained, and easily
   worked. It is not durable in contact with soil. It is widely used for
   construction, pulp, furniture, and musical instruments. Planted in
   shelter belts and as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Norway spruce (England), Gran (Norway), Rød gran (Denmark),
   Metsäkuusi (Finland), Fichte (Germany). FURTHER INF: It grows best in
   cool, humid climates on rich soils. Preferred soils include
   well-drained sandy loams. It also grows well on almost all other types
   of soils. Permanently waterlogged soils inhibit growth, but it does
   occur on poorly drained soils and in bogs. Growth rates increase with
   increased soil organic material and are positively correlated to the
   nitrogen content of the soil. Soil pH often ranged from 3.7 to 4.4. It
   occurs at elevations up to 2000 m in the Bavarian Alps. It is tolerant
   of shade but not very wind firm.
