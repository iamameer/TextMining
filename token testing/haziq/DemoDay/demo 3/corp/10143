   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect, ascendant to decumbent herb or sub-shrub, to 1 m
   diameter and height, multi-branched, stems occasionally woody at the
   base. Leaves trifoliolate; leaflets variable to 30 (rarely 40) mm long,
   12-15 mm wide. Papilionaceous flowers bright yellow. USE: Permanent
   pastures for intensive grazing in grass-legume associations. GROWING
   PERIOD: Short-lived perennial herb, but tends to behave like an annual
   and plants seldom live longer than 2-3 years. COMMON NAMES:
   Stylosanthes. FURTHER INF: It is native of Brazil and Venezuela, where
   it can be found between latitudes 10°N and 22°S and from the lowlands
   up to 1000 m in elevation. It is well adapted to sub-humid and dryland
   areas. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall between 500-2500 mm and
   with a 3-6 month dry season. It is killed by frost. Occurs naturally on
   infertile, well-drained, sandy and sandy clay loam soils with a pH
   below 5.5. Only nodulates effectively at low soil pH. Tolerant of high
   levels of Al and Mn. Due to its free-seeding habit, high seed yields,
   hard seeds and a persistent soil seed bank, it can invade cultivated
   land. Up to 12-13 t/ha/year DM under good conditions, but more often
   3-6 t/ha DM. Little dry season growth.
