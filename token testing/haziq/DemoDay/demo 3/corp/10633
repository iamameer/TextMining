   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an erect, aquatic, perennial herb reaching 1-3 m in
   height. Similar to narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia) but more
   robust. It spreads extensively by rhizomes so that 3000-4000 m^2 may
   consist of only a few individual plants. It has long, slender, and
   green stalks topped with brown, fluffy, sausage-shaped flowering heads.
   Flowering is monoecious, the two portions of the spike are continuous
   or nearly so. USE: All parts of the plant are edible; the leaves can be
   used in weaving of mats etc; all parts of the plant have medicinal
   properties and the plant is used for waste water treatment. GROWING
   PERIOD: Long-lived perennial. COMMON NAMES: Road-leaved cattail, Reed
   mace. FURTHER INF: It is a persistent emergent found in almost all
   wetland plant communities from deep marshes to open bogs, ponds, lakes,
   slow mowing stream and depressional areas growing on wet substrates and
   often in 0-30 cm or more of standing water. It can also form floating
   mats. It is an obligate wetland indicator plant species. It tolerates
   perennial flooding and reduced soil conditions. In some cases, it can
   form extensive monotypes that may be considered undesirable because
   they lack diversity. Its range of adaptability is similar to
   narrow-leaved cattail, however, it tolerates less salinity, less
   calcareous waters and is generally occurs on more shallow water.
