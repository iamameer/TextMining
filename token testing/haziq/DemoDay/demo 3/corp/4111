   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized evergreen, dioecious tree reaching
   20-25 m in height and a trunk diameter of up to 40-50 cm, with compound
   leaves with 5-7 leaflets and ellipsoid, 6-7 cm long fruits with one
   seed. USES It is a source of an oleoresin and volatile oil used as a
   solvent and a pale plasticizer in lacquers. Its edible kernels can be
   roasted and used in confections, baking and cooking and as a flavouring
   for ice-cream, they contain 70% of an oil that can be used for cooking.
   The hard and thick shell that enclose the kernel makes a good fuel and
   charcoal. Also the resin-rich wood makes a good firewood. The pulp is
   edible after cooking and yields a cooking oil. The young shoots are
   edible and may be used in salads. Mature trees yield a gum used in
   pharmaceutical plasters, ointments, and varnishes. It is used to scent
   soaps and inexpensive technical preparations. It makes a good windbreak
   as it resists strong winds and even typhoons. It can be planted as an
   ornamental avenue and shade tree. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. First
   havest after 7-10 years. COMMON NAMES Pili nut, Pili, Anangi. FURTHER
