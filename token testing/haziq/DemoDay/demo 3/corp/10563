   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Robust grass, with tangled stolons and rhizomes;
   shallow-rooted. Flowering culms up to 3 m tall, up to 5 cm diameter at
   the base. Leaf blades up to 120 cm long and up to 10 cm wide. Terminal
   and axillary inflorescences can have 5ˆ8 slender racemes. USE: Cut and
   carry, silage and green feed during dry conditions. Used as living
   fence, soil erosion control, mulching and as a soil conditioner in
   drained swamps and as contour strips, especially in combination with
   cassava (Manihot esculenta) Planted as a break to reduce insect pests
   in run-down tea plantation and to combat bacterial wilt of potatoes.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Regrowth can be harvested at 4, 6, 10 or 12
   weeks intervals. COMMON NAMES: Guatemala grass. FURTHER INF: It is
   native of the Americas from Mexico to Peru. Now widely distributed
   throughout the tropics as a fodder plant. Requires reliable rain or
   soil moisture but can remain green over a short dry season; reported to
   tolerate drought better than Pennisetum purpureum. Tolerant of
   waterlogging and flooding. Found in the humid tropical lowlands at
   altitudes up to 1800-2000 m. Reported temperature range: 18ˆ30°C. Best
   in fertile, well-drained soils but can tolerate low pH and some Al. Can
   grow on ultisols, podsols, oxisols, peats, acid sulphate soils and very
   acid coastal marine sands. It can become a weed in cultivated areas.
   Annual DM yields of 18ˆ22 t/ha, cutting at 10ˆ25 cm above soil surface.
