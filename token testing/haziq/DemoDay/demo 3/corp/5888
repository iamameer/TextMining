   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A evergreen shrub or small tree 3-20 m in height,
   depending on growing conditions. The trunk may reach a diameter of 100
   cm. The trunk can be from very short to 1/3 of the tree height. In dry
   sites the tree is poorly formed with a straggly crown. USES The wood is
   used for durable poles, fenceposts, bearings, bolts, shafts, frames,
   wheels and firewood and charcoal. The tree is planted for shelterbelts,
   shade, soil conservation, and erosion control. Mentioned as a possible
   agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. On suitable sites the
   growth may reach 3 m per year. The tree can be harvested after 8 years
   from a seedling crop and after 6 years from subsequent coppice crops.
   It withstands droughts of up to 7 months. COMMON NAMES Coolibah,
   Western coolibah, Flooded box, Coolabah. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: E. coolabah. Coolibah can be found at elevations from sea
   level to 1000 m, but most common between 100-350 m. Its natural
   latitudinal range in Australia is 14-32.5Â°S. It is usually found on
   seaonally inundated country around the edges of swamps or lagoons, or
   along watercourses. Under irrigation it should be possible to grow in
   deserts. The tree is fire tender. Annual wood production potential is
   3-7 m3/ha.
