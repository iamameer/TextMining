   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Variable grass, spreading, erect, with ascending,
   scrambling, or stoloniferous growth habit, and fertile culms 15ˆ60
   (ˆ100) cm tall. Stems rooting at the nodes. Leaf-blade lanceolate to
   linear-lanceolate, 2ˆ10 (ˆ16) cm long and 3ˆ15 mm wide. USE: Permanent
   pasture , frequently naturalised on heavily grazed communal land where
   it provides good ground cover against erosion and good quality edible
   feed. Useful as a shade tolerant cover under trees. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial or annual. The flowering season in Indonesia is
   April-November. COMMON NAMES: Centipede grass, Lucuntu grass. FURTHER
   INF: Synonym: I. macrurum. Native to tropical South-East Asia and
   naturalised in Central and South America. Occurs up to 2000 m at 7ºS in
   Indonesia, and 1300 m at 9.5ºN in Costa Rica. Found on grassy
   roadsides, banks of terraces, along ditches and forest margins, and as
   a weed in upland rice fields. Occurs under average annual rainfall of
   800ˆ2000 mm, often with a pronounced dry season. Tends to dry off
   quickly under dry conditions and may behave more as an annual at the
   lower end of the rainfall range. Has some drought tolerance but is
   intolerant of waterlogging. Grows on well-drained, light to medium
   textured soils (not heavy clays). Adapted to low fertility and pH (4ˆ)
   4.5ˆ5.5 (ˆ7). Intolerant of poor drainage. It can become a weed in
   annual and perennial crops. Particularly in Indonesia it is a common
   weed in rainfed rice. Yields of fresh green material may be up to 30
   t/ha.
