   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall evergreen tree reaching 30-40 m in height and
   a girth of 5-7 m, while girths up to 13 m have been recorded. In the
   open it forms a large, spreading crown and often has a short, crooked
   trunk, while in a close crop it produces a tall, clean, straight bole.
   Leaves up to 45 cm long, elliptical-lanceolate. In its natural habitat
   the stem and branches are almost invariably covered with a thick layer
   of moss. USES The wood is hard, and durable under cover, used for
   buildings and as a fuel. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Buk
   oak, Buk, Bujrat, Shalshi. FURTHER INF Buk oak occurs in eastern
   Himalaya from Nepal and eastwards at elevations between 1000-3000 m. It
   grows on any aspect, as well as on ridges, but thrives on northerly
   slopes. It is shade-bearing in youth, while older trees develop best
   with full overhead light, but it requires much side shade to prevent
   the formation of side branches and promote a straight clean bole. It is
   very susceptible to damage by fire. (pH estimated by the compiler).
