   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree reaching a height of 30-50 m and a
   diameter of 0.9-1.5 m. The bole cylindrical, slender, straight and
   branchless, rising to 20-30 m and a broad spherical crown with thick
   foliage. The shining leaves are 15 cm long and bigger when young,
   elliptic, acute at the ends, keeled towards the base, and stipulate,
   with a pair of distinct leafy stipules at the base. USE: Used in palm
   soup in Ghana and eaten by elephants and other mammals. The timber is
   good for outdoor uses (harbour works, railway sleepers), buildings
   (carpentry, floors, facings, indoor and outdoor woodwork) and for
   cabinet making. A bark decoction is prescribed for anaemia,
   stomach-ache and indigestion, as part of an infusion for treating
   jaundice, bark infusion to treat gonorrhoea; a decoction of leaves is
   used as a wash for measles. Also planted as a shade tree.GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Opepe, Bilinga. FURTHER INF:
   Scientific synonym: Sarcocephalus trillesii. The tree occur naturally
   within the latitudinal range of 10°N-5°S at elevations between sea
   level and 500 m. It is native to moist evergreen and
   transitional-to-moist semi-deciduous forests. The species is found
   throughout the tropical rainforest of West Africa and extends south to
   Angola. A sun-loving species, it regenerates abundantly in gaps and
   openings and is often almost gregarious in the transition zone between
   freshwater swamp and lowland forest. It does not grow well on
   excessively wet soils or on lateritic ones that dry out completely in
   the dry season. Annual wood production potential is 3-10 m3/ha.
