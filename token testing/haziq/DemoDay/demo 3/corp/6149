   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small- to medium-sized tree, 5-10 m tall, or it
   may become a large tree reaching 24 m and 2 m in girth. Branches widely
   spreading, more or less horizontal, often supported by stilt roots.
   Bark yellow, grey or green-grey, smooth to slightly rough with a few
   flaking pieces. Leaves broadly ovate to oblong, 5-20 x 7-15 cm, green
   or greyish-green. Figs small, less than 10-14 mm in diameter, in pairs
   in the leaf axils and often clustered at the ends of branches among the
   leaves, globose, paired, glabrous or with fine silky hairs, green
   turning red, sweet and succulent; stalkless or shortly stalked. USE:
   The figs are edible. The wood is used as firewood and charcoal. In
   Sudan, cloth and tannin is made from the bark. Lines of the tree can be
   planted as a windbreak. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   African rock fig. FURTHER INF: It occurs on rocky outcrops, where it
   splits rocks; along dry watercourses or in open country; frequently in
   valleys, where it reaches its greatest size. The species also occurs in
   fringe forest in savannah areas, especially in swampy ground, and in
   swamp forest in coastal areas. Originally collected in Ethiopia, it
   occurs in many parts of tropical Africa and is typically found in dry
   country in wooded grassland and bush. In Uganda, it is found in dry
   localities, usually among rocks. In swampy ground, the numerous aerial
   roots develop into stilt roots.
