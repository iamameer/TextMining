   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized evergreen tree reaching up to 7-18 m
   height in the wild state. The bark and leaves are strongly aromatic. In
   an unharvested state, the trunk is stout, 30-60 cm in diameter, with a
   thick, grey bark and branches set low down. Under cultivation, the
   continual removal of shoots by cropping almost to ground level results
   in the formation of a dense bush with a number of leafy coppiced shoots
   of 2-2.5 m in height. USES The bark is used as flavoring, for a
   distilled essential oil and for extracted oleresins, also used as
   flavoring. Oil extracted from both leaves and bark is used in flavoring
   and perfumery. Cinnamon oil is a source of eugenol. The spice are used
   in baked goods, apple pies, candy, table sauces, meat seasonnings,
   beverages, tobacco and pickles. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Require 3-5
   years from planting to first harvest, thereafter harvested every 2-3
   years. The tree have a 10 years economical life. Fruits ripen in about
   120 days. COMMON NAMES Cinnamon, True cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: C. zeylanicum. Cinnamon is native of
   Sri Lanka and southern India. In the tropics, it can be found at
   elevations from sea level to 2000 m, but it is best grown at elevations
   below 500 m. It require a warm and wet climate, but waterlogged areas
   should be avoided, as they give an undesirable bitter harvest product.
   Also rocky and stony ground is unsuitable. The expected yield of quills
   is 56-67 kg/ha after 3-4 years, subsequently increasing to 168-224
   kg/ha. About 63 kg/ha of chips and approximately 2.5 t/ha of undried
   leaves can also be obtained. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species.
