   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A medium-sized evergreen tree (palm) reaching 7-25 m in
   height and a trunk diameter of 30-60 cm. It produces basal suckers. The
   roots are spongy and not extending to a great depth. The palm may have
   18-24 leaves, usually 5-7 m long but sometimes up to twice as long.
   USES: The starch stored in the trunk is used as a staple food and can
   also be converted to alcohol for use as a bio-fuel. Usually, wet starch
   is boiled, fried or roasted, alone or mixed with other foodstuffs. It
   is also be used industrially in the manufacture of cakes, noodles,
   kerupuk and custards powders. Non-food uses include sizing pastes for
   paper and textiles. Young trunks, pith and pith refuse can be fed to
   animals. The 'bark' can be used as timber or fuel. Walls, ceilings,
   fences, cordage, mats and baskets can be made from the leaves. The
   growing point of the palm (palm cabbage) may be eaten raw or cooked.
   Certain larvae and mushroom living off the plant are edible. KILLING
   T.: May not tolerate 10^oC for prolonged periods. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. Each trunk produces a vast terminal inflorescence when 7-15
   years old and then dies after fruiting. COMMON NAMES: Sago palm, Smooth
   sago palm, Pokok, Pohon, Sagu, Rumbia, Sagoutier, Pohon rumbia, Kirai,
   Ambulung, Kersula, Lapia, Sak-sak, Lumbia, Thagu-bin, Sa kuu, Sa khu.
   FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: M. rumphii, M. squarrosum. Sago palm
   occurs wild in Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and the Philippines. The
   latitudinal range is 13^oN to 23^oS and it can be found at elevations
   between sea level and 700 m or even up to 1200 m. It thrives in lowland
   swampy coastal plains, flood plains of rivers and higher up on flat
   valley floors, with a relative air humidity about 90% and an irradiance
   of about 9 MJ/m^2. Occasional flooding, even with saline water is
   tolerated. Mentioned as a useful agro-forestry species. A single palm
   may yield about 180-350 kg sago. In the swamp groves, there are about
   60-140 palms/ha. Top annual yield of dry starch from the first crop of
   palms of short life cycle in Malaysia is about 25 t/ha, equivalent to
   138 trunks of 180 kg each. Yields of the subsequent ratoon crop may be
   about 15/t/ha, from 85 trunks of 180 kg each. Production from
   uncultivated palms may be 20-400 kg per plant.
