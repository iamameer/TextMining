   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized, spiny deciduous tree reaching 8-18 m
   in height and up to 80 cm in trunk diameter. The crown is thin and
   open. USES Wood used for firewood, charcoal, furniture, and
   construction. Sheep and goats eat fallen pods and leaves and browse
   young shoots. Pods can be leached and used for human food. Mentioned as
   a possible agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. May reach 10
   m in height in 15 years even under harsh conditions. Withstands
   droughts of 10-12 months. COMMON NAMES Tamarugo. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: P. chilensis. Tamarugo occurs naturally within the latitudinal
   range 18-21Â°S, at elevations from 1000 to 2500 m. The tree can be found
   on the arid salt flats of northern Chile, sometimes with salt
   incrustation of 10-60 cm thickness at the surface and the water table
   at a depth of 20 m. Often these areas are without rain for years,
   however, at night there is a high relative humidity and the trees
   absorb moisture through the leaves. Tamarugo is drought hardy and
   regenerates rapidly. The seedlings need to be watered during the first
   year. Under less harsh conditions, the plant might spread
   uncontrollably and become a serious weed. Photosynthesis pathway C3.
   Annual wood production potential is 2-4 m3/ha. Each tamarugo tree
   yields up to 160 kg of pods, leaves, and small twigs, which layer the
   soil beneath the tree and provide yearround feed.
