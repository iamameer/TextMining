   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous, profusely branched shrub or less often
   a small tree, 2-15 m tall, with smooth grey bark. Leaves opposite,
   elliptic-ovate or rotundate, dark green above, paler beneath, glabrous
   or, rarely, slightly pubescent, with acuminate or, rarely, obtuse or
   acute apex and prominent venation below, 7-20 x 2-11 cm. Flowers
   greenish-yellow, yellow or cream, fulvous-pubescent, borne in dense
   axillary cymes, sweet scented. Fruit globose, very smooth and shiny,
   3-4.5 x 2.5-4.2 cm, greenish when immature, changing to yellowish-brown
   when ripe, contain 4-5 woody seeds up to 1.6 cm long. USE: The ripe
   fruit pulp is edible and has a pleasant chocolate-like flavour and the
   flowers are a source of honey. Wood is used as firewood and charcoal.
   Roots and bark are used in traditional medicine; for example, in
   Tanzania an extract from the roots is used to treat worm infections.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Common wild medlar. FURTHER
   INF: It is commonly found in evergreen forest, riverine forest and
   bushland, wooded bushland and wooded grassland, and sometimes on rocky
   outcrops and termite mounds. Found throughout Africa from Ethiopia to
   Nigeria and south to South Africa and into Asia at sea level to 2400m.
   The plant is also cultivated in India, northern Australia and Trinidad.
   It grows naturally in riverine-lowland forests and
   Brachystegia-Combretum woodland. The species is fire sensitive. It can
   be found on volcanic ash soils, light yellowish-brown to
   reddish-yellow, gritty, sandy clay loams and red to dark red friable
   clays with lateritic horizon.
