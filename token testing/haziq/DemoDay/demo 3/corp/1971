   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect or clambering succulent herbaceous branched tuber
   crop up to more than 1 m tall, the stems sometimes quadrangular or even
   winged. Leaves alternate, imparipinnate, short-stalked, 10-30 cm long,
   5-15 cm wide, the leaflets opposite or alternate, very unequal in size
   and shape, the larger often petiolulate, ovate to ovate-oblong,
   enequilateral, apically acuminate to acute, basally subcordate, 2-10 cm
   long, 1-6 cm wide, the smaller more blunt apically, more cordate
   basally, broadly ovate to orbicular, 2Ë†15 mm in diameter, thinly to
   densely pubescent. Flowers white or blue, pedunculate in lateral, many
   flowered cymes, the hairy peduncle 5-15 cm long, the jointed hairy
   pedicels 3-35 mm long. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobate, 1.5-2 cm in
   diameter, the lobes acute or acuminate. Corolla twice as long as calyx,
   3.5-4 cm in diameter. Anthers free, erect, poricidal, yellow. Fruit a
   globose 2-celled berry, many-seeded, yellowish green. The tubers are
   mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. USES: It is cultivated
   for its edible tubers. Tubers are one of the temperate staples, eaten
   boiled, baked, fried, stewed, candied with syrup, or pureed and they
   are processed into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose, and alcohol and
   they can be canned or dehydrated etc. Surplus potatoes are used for
   fodder and alcohol, and chemurgic applications. The flour can be used
   for baking. Potato starch is used to determine the diastatic value of
   starch. Boiled with weak sulphuric acid, potato starch is changed into
   glucose and fermented into alcohol. It is estimated that potatoes would
   give 104 liters ethanol per ton of production. Rotten potatoes and the
   waste in the potato chip industry can be converted to butanol with a
   greater energy content than ethanol. Twenty percent butanol can be
   added to regular gas and up to 40% to diesel as extenders without
   engine modification. Ripe potato juice is excellent for cleaning
   cottons, silks, and woolens. Root and leaf diffusates of growing potato
   plants possess cardiotonic activity. Dried ethanol extracts of
   above-ground parts show marked hypotensive and myotropic action and a
   spasmolytic and soothing effect on intestinal musculature. Ethanol
   extracts of leaves have antifungal properties, active against
   Phytophthora infestans. Leaves, seeds, and tuber extracts show
   antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacteria. The tubers contain 8-28% starch and 1-4% protein. KILLING T.:
   -1^oC. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial, grown as an annual,
   growing 90-160 days. COMMON NAMES: Potato, spud, Irish potato, English
   potato, pomme de terre, papa, patata, kartoffel, aardappel, alv,
   watalu, kentang, yang shu, shue tsai, viazi, poni, turma, batata,
   aardappel, bareisko, jyagaima, ganja, alu, toru, cartoful, hardoppel.
   FURTHER INF.: The green parts of the potato plant contain toxins.
   Flowers are common but fruits are only set in cool climates or under a
   day length of 16-17 hours. The fruits are berries, similar to small
   tomatoes. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Wet through Tropical Very Dry to
   Wet Forest Life Zones, potato is reported to tolerate annual
   precipitations of 900 to 4100 mm, annual temperatures of 3.6 to 27.8^oC
   and a pH of 4.2 to 8.2. Potatoes are a cool weather crop, the optimal
   temperature for growth being 15-20^oC for most cvs. Growth of tubers is
   best at a soil temperature of 17-20^oC, with usually no tubers formed
   above 32^oC. They perform well on a wide variety of soils, sandy loams,
   silt loams, loams, and peats. Soil moisture tensions between 40 and 60
   centibars seem to produce the best yields. The species is native to the
   Andean mountains between 10^oN and 20^oS. The latitudinal range is
   60^oN to 40^oS. In the tropics, potato can be grown at altitude between
   400-2500 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3:1. Yields of 10-35 t/ha have been
   recorded.
