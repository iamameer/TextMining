   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A deciduous tree up to 10-20 m in height with spreading
   branches making a light crown. The bole almost always short and
   malformed, and up to 40-50 cm in diameter. Flowers striking
   blue-violet, in clusters, each flower bell shaped, to 4 cm, usually on
   the bare tree before leaf growth. USE: The tree creates pleasant open
   shade and can be used effectively as a screen or as a windbreak. It is
   widely grown as an ornamental throughout the highland tropics. Bark and
   roots are used for syphilis. Leaves also used as a vulnerary. The
   timber is yellowish-white, hard, moderately heavy, fine textured, easy
   to work, and is used for carpentry and also as fuel. The flowers
   provide good forage for bees. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Brazilian rose wood, jacaranda, mimosa-leaved jacaranda. FURTHER INF:
   It is native to Brazil and Argentina but has been introduced as an
   ornamental in most parts of the tropics. The tree is frost tender when
   young. The tree is drought hardy, termite resistant and tolerates salt
   winds. It can be found elevations between 500-2400 m. A deep-rooted,
   greedy feeder so that few plants or crops can grow below it; therefore,
   best planted away from flowerbeds. Leaf fall is also considerable.
