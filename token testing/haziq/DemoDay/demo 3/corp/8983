   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub or small tree reaching up to 10 m in height,
   with a wide spreading crown and a deep root system. The fruit is
   globose, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow or reddish-yellow. USES It is
   cultivated from its edible fruits, eaten fresh, sun-dried, or used in
   canning, jams, juice, wine and liqueur. The tree is often grown as an
   ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Japanese apricot,
   Boir, Foung, Phung, Mo'. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Armenica mume.
   Japanese apricot is native of China, Japan, and probably also of the
   northern parts of Laos and Vietnam. It require a cold rest season with
   temperatures below 7Â°C to break bud dormancy. Late frosts may kill
   flowers and summer rains may lead to diseases. In the tropics best
   results are obtained in seasonal climate at elevations between
   1200-2000 m, but the tree can also be grown under continuously cropping
   conditions at elevations between 900-1400 m. Annual fruit yields may be
   between 10-25 t/ha.
