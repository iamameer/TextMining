   cm (rarely -1.4 m), sometimes prostrate. Leaves trifoliolate, the
   central leaflet from 16-26 mm long and 3-6 mm wide. Flowers yellow. Pod
   about 1 cm long. USE: Used for permanent pastures, cut and carry as
   green feed, or for hay and in silvipasture systems undersowing
   Eucalytus and Dalbergia forests as well as a component in watershed and
   soil conservation programs. Can also be used as a ley in cropping
   systems with nitrogen benefits up to 90 kg/ha. Used for feeding cattle,
   goats, sheep, pigs and poultry. KILLING T: Tops are killed by frost but
   crowns may withstand light frost. GROWING PERIOD: Self-regenerating
   annual or short-lived perennial herb. It may flower 60-70 days after
   germination, and plants will flower within 40 days of the start of the
   season. Seeds ripens over a period of 15-16 days after flowering.

   elevations between sea level and 1500 m. Occurs in areas with an annual
   rainfall between 350-2000 mm and annual average temperatures between
   23-27°C. Plant growth is limited when night temperatures decline to
