   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A much-branched, slender, glabrous shrub or small
   tree reaching 2-6 m in height with greyish-brown bark, entire, 1.5-5 cm
   long and 2 cm broad leaves and white or red flowers with a pleasant
   fragrance. The fruits are globolar, about 0.5 cm in diameter. USES A
   reddish-orange dye is obtained from the leaves and used for dying
   leather, silk, cotton, wool, hair, skin, teeth, fingernails, etc, and
   used in hair shampoos, dyers, conditioners and rinses. An essential oil
   is extracted from the flowers and used in perfumery. Leaves, bark,
   roots and seed have medicinal properties. The wood is hard and can be
   used for making small objects. It is often grown as an ornamental hedge
   plant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Plants produce their best yields
   during the first 4-8 years after planting, but are often left in the
   field for 12-15 or even 40 years. Under intensive cultivation the
   plants are usually harvested twice a year from the second year onwards.
   COMMON NAMES Henna, Henne, Cypress shrub, Alhena, Egyptian privet,
   Camphire, Alkanna, Inai, Pacar kuku, Pacar kuku, Hinna, Cinamomo, Dan,
   Krapeen, Kaaw, Thian khaao, Thian daeng, Thian king, La mon, Nhuom mong
   tay, Enah, Jabi, Lalle, Uhie inine, Mhina, Laali. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: L. spinosa, L. alba. Henna is probably native of
   the region from Iran to north-western India. It tolerates low air
   humidity and drought well. Ideal conditions for rain-fed cultivation
   are well-distributed rainfall, with two dry periods a year in order to
   facilitate post-harvest leaf drying. Henna removes large quantities of
   nutrients form the soil. A yield of 1000 kg dry leaves removes 180-190
   kg N, 100-150 kg K2O and 10-30 kg P2O5 from the field. Under irrigation
   yields of dry leaves may be 2-4 t/ha, while under rainfed conditions in
   northern India yields of 700-1500 kg/ha are obtained. (GMIN estimated
   by the compiler).
