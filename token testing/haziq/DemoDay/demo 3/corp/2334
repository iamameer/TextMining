   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A much branched, slow growing, evergreen, small to
   medium sized tree. Under cultivation the tree usually reaches 9-20 m in
   height and up to 50 cm in diameter. As a forest tree it can attain
   heights of 30-38 m with diameters of up to 150 cm. USES The fruit is
   eaten fresh, used to flavor ice cream, and made into syrup and jam. A
   milky latex from the bark is used in chewing gum. The fine, hard wood
   is used to make various wooden articles. The tree is mentioned as a
   useful agroforestry species. KILLING T Young trees may be killed by
   -1°C, but older trees can survive temperatures as low as -3 to -4.5°C
   for some hours. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. The tree begins to fruit 3-4
   years after planting and yields increase up to 25-30 years. The fruit
   takes about 120 days to mature from flowering. Latex are obtained by
   tapping the trunk once every 2-3 years. COMMON NAMES Sapodilla, Chicle,

   M. zapotilla, Achras sapota, Ackras Cosaguigo, A. zapodilla, Nispero
   achras, Sapota achras, Calocarpum spp, Lucuma nervosa. Sapodilla is a
   native of Central America. It thrives near the seashore in the humid
   tropical lowlands below 500-900 m, but can be found up to 2500 m in
   elevation and can also be grown in some subtropical regions. It does
   not like a hot dry summer, but is quit drought resistant. The tree is
   salt sensitive, though it withstands salt sprays close to the sea and
   can be grafted on rootstocks of M. hexandra to allow fruit production
   on saline land. With its tough branches the tree tolerates strong
   winds, but on sandy soils the tree can be uprooted by the wind. A good
   tree may yield up to 2500-3000 fruits per year or about 250-300 kg.
   Annual yields per ha of 20-30 t have been reported in Florida, 20-25 t
   in the Philippines and 20-80 t in India.
