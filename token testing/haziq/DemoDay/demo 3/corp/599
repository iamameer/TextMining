   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Tea is a woody shrub with pale - dark green leaves under
   natural conditions reaching a height of 5-15 m. In cultivation it is
   usually trimmed to 1-2 m tall. It has a taproot or oblique root system.
   The taproot may reach 3 m deep, but 1.5 is the usual. Development of
   lateral roots depends on environmental conditions. The trunk is
   straight, monopodial and the bark brown to grey. When a dormant bud
   develops it produces 1 or 2 small non-serrated bracts 5-10 mm long,
   which drop shortly. Then 1-2 pre-leaves appear 7-30 mm long without
   serrations or prominent veins. Then, normally, 4-8 true leaves appear
   followed by a new dormant bud. The true leaves are persistent,
   alternate with short pedicels 5-10 mm long. The lamina is elliptical to
   lanceolate and 7-22 cm long and 3-8 wide. It is sharply acuminate at
   the apex and cuneiform at the base. All leaf types, whether pubescent
   or glabrous, tender or leathery, are glossy and very green. The China
   differs from the Assam variety in its leaf characteristic which is
   coreacious and smaller; 4-10 cm long and about 1.5 cm wide. Flowers are
   pedicellate and develop from leaf axils on young branches and are
   either solitary or in clusters of 2-3. The pedicel is 8-10 mm long,
   glabrous (sometimes villous) with 2-3 caducous, broad, rounded and
   ciliate bracts. There are 5-6 green sepals which are herbaceous and
   slightly membraneous, 3-5 mm long, glabrous to villous and continue up
   to the fruit. The white corulla has 7-8 petals attached to the base of
   the androecium, they have more than 200 stamens 8-13 mm long with
   yellow anthers. The 8-12 mm-long gynaeceum with a superior ovary is
   very pubescent. Tea is practically allogamous and pollination is by
   insects and wind. Fruits are capsules with loculicidal dehiscence and
   are 1-1.5 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter with 1 to even 5 loculi, each
   with 2 seeds. Seeds are spherical to hemispherical, 0.8-1.6 cm in
   diameter and smooth and brown when mature. The endosperm has 2
   cotyledons surrounding the embryo, the seed wall is hard and thick and
   adheres to an internal tegument which is thick, tough and shiny. There
   are 400-600 seeds to the kilo. USES: Camelia sinensis has been known
   for thousands of years and is one of today's most important beverages,
   cultivated on the 5 continents; cultivated first by the Chinese over
   3000 years ago and introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 17th
   century. Depending on whether the leaves undergo fermentation the tea
   is black or green. Green leaves are steamed and dried to produce green
   tea or leaves are withered, fermented, and dried to provide black tea.
   It has a stimulant effect due to caffeine. Steam distillation of black
   tea yields an essential oil. Tea extract is used as a flavour in
   alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods,
   gelatins, and puddings. Air-dried tea seed yields a clear golden-yellow
   oil resembling sasanqua oil, but the seed cake, containing saponin, is
   not suitable for fodder. Refined tea seed oil, made by removing the
   free fatty acids with caustic soda, then bleaching the oil with
   Fuller's earth and a sprinkling of bone black, makes an oil suitable
   for use in manufacture of oil for burning purposes, and in all respects
   is considered a favourable substitute for rapeseed, olive, or lard
   oils. The oil is different from cottonseed, corn, or sesame oils in
   that it is a non-drying oil and is not subject to oxidation changes,
   thus making it very suitable for use in the textile industry; it
   remains liquid below -18^o.C. Tea is a potential source of food colours
   (black, green, orange, yellow, etc.). KILLING T.: 0 to -5°C depending
   on the cultivar, var. sinensis withstands -5°C, whereas the leaves of
   var. assamica are killed by 0°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Harvest of
   leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a maximum at 7-10 years.
   The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes 270-360 days to mature
   and seeds are normally produced after 4-5 years. The economic life of
   the plant is about 40 years, but sometimes the shrubs are kept in
   production 60-70, or even 100 years. COMMON NAMES: Tea, The, Te, Tee,
   Tsa. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: C. thea, C. theifera, Thea
   sinensis, T. bohea, T. viridis. Tea can be grown in subtropical lowland
   and up to about 1800 m or even 2400-3000 m in the tropics, but the
   majority of the production takes place between 750 and 1500 m. Tea
   originates in the mountains of Southeast Asia, it is now grown between
   40°N and 33°S. Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are
   beneficial. To low and too high humidity can reduce yields and
   encourage disease. Harvesting: Terminal sprouts with 2-3 leaves are
   usually hand-plucked, 10 kg of green shoots (75-80% water) produce
   about 2.5 kg of dried tea. Bushes are plucked every 7-15 days,
   depending on the development of the tender shoots. One ton of tea
   removes 45-60 kg N, 4-7 kg P and 20-30 kg K from the field. Optimum
   yield is about 3.0 t/ha, in Africa average yields are between 0.5-2.0
   t/ha. Because most tea plants are grown on hillsides, erosion control
   is often necessary.
