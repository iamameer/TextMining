   originates from the region extending from the western Himalayas to
   southern Russia and Greece. It is a cosmopolitan weed, wild and
   cultivated, whose origin is uncertain. The plant is easily dispersed by
   running water and seeds are easily spread by the wind, water, with crop
   seeds or through bird droppings and is often considered a troublesome
   weed. In Java it occurs at elevations up to 1800 m. It has a C4
   photosynthesis pathway. Top yields in Europe are about 50 t/ha crop or
   2-2.5 kg/mÀù per cutting round. In the tropics yields of 12-17 t/ha have
   been reported. (pH and rainfall estimated by the compiler).
