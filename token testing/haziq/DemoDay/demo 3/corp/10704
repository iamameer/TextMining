   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Highbush blueberry is a crown-forming deciduous shrub with
   two to five stems arising from a single bole. It typically grows from
   2-3 m in height. The fruit is a sweet, juicy, blue-black berry about 7
   to 10 mm in diameter, containing several small seeds (nutlet) about 1.2
   mm long. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing 3 years to first bearing,
   and with a minimum period of about 160 days from flowering to harvest.
   COMMON NAMES: Highbush blueberry, Swamp blueberry. FURTHER INF: It
   occupies numerous habitats but seldom occurs as community dominant. Two
   habitats where it occurs as a dominant or codominant are open swamps or
   bogs and high-elevation balds. It require about 100-400 hours of
   temperatures less than 5-7°C to overcome the dormancy period. It
   require cool nights during the fruit-ripening period. It is intolerant
   of shade. It is frequently found at relatively low elevations along the
   edges of swamps and bogs; along the sandy margins of lakes, ponds, and
   streams and within open areas of moist woods. Plants can withstand
   extended periods of flooding.
