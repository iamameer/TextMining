   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A herbaceous to woody, leguminous sub-shrub capable of
   reaching a height of 2-3 m in just 7 months. Flowers purple with white
   markings or white and 2.5 cm wide. Pods usually contain 8 to 16 seeds.
   USE: It is grown as a cover crop and for the manifacture of insecticide
   (rotenone), fish poison and mollucide. It is also grown as an
   ornamental and as green manure. The insecticide is used to control
   insects both on plants, animals and in buildings, with the chemical
   effect lasting up to 3 months. It is poisonous to animals and humans.
   GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial that fruits and flower all year
   round. A leaf crop can harvested for rotanone in only 180 days. COMMON
   NAMES: Fishbean, Fish-poison bean. FURTHER INF: Synonym: T. periculosa.
   It is native of West and Central Africa. It can be found at elevations
   between sea level and 2100 m. It is widely cultivated in East Africa.
   Found in widely varying habitats, including savannah-like vegetation,
   grassland, forest margins and shrubland, wasteland and fallow fields.
   In acid soils, it grows much better than Leucaena leucocephala, forming
   root nodules and fixing atmospheric nitrogen where the latter does not.
   On poor soils, however, it grows more slowly and is more prone to
   diseases. It is susceptible to frost and flowering occurs on decreasing
   day-lengths.
