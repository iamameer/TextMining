   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is usually a small tree, 4-8 m in height but
   occasionally reaching 15 m. Bark grey, yellow or brown, mottled, rather
   smooth to fissured. Leaves alternate, simple, crowded at the ends of
   the branches, large, obovate-oblong to oblanceolate, 8-35 x 4-13 cm.
   USE: Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable; seeds are pounded to
   extract the starchy content, which is made into cakes. The tree
   provides firewood, fibre and tannin and can be grown as an ornamental.
   The fruit, bark, wood and root can be used as fish poison, insecticide
   and are also poisonous to people. Root, bark and juice are used
   medicinally. The fruit is used to treat cough, asthma and diarrhoea.
   Seeds are used to treat eye inflammation and by midwives for
   parturition. In Malaysia, the leaves traditionally are used to treat
   high blood pressure and as a depurative. Pounded leaves are said to
   treat chicken pox. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: freshwater
   mangrove. FURTHER INF: It is considered a mangrove associate but can
   also be found in tropical rainforest areas, open lowlands and thickets.
   Occurring always near water: along riverbanks and in freshwater swamps,
   and occasionally in the less saline areas of mangrove swamps. The
   species cannot tolerate even light frost. It favours the wet tropical,
   moist topical and wet subtropical climatic zones.
