   DESCRIPTION: It is generally short and straight, from 6-20 m in height
   and from 36-60 cm in d.b.h. The acorns are from 2-3 cm long. The bark
   is thin and flaky. Roots are extensive, and may grow through fractured
   and jointed rock to a depth of or more than 24 m to tap groundwater
   reserves. Stands are typically from 90 to 100 years old but trees may
   become up to 400 years old. USE: The wood is not used in manufacturing
   because of the tree's frequently short stature and poor form. Products
   are limited to fenceposts and fuelwood. The tree is browsed by
   livestock and wildlife. Also planted for erosion control and as an
   ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Blue oak. FURTHER
   INF: It is native of California, North America and occurs in a
   Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It
   grows in soils derived from a variety of parent materials. Soils are
   characteristically shallow, skeletal, infertile, thermic, and
   moderately to excessively well drained. Soil textures range from
   gravelly loam to gravelly clay-loam.
