   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous broadleaf tree or shrub reaching 4-12 m
   in height, with short trunk to 45 cm in diameter, and spreading
   branches. The leaves are alternate, short-petioled, undulate,
   oblong-elliptic or oblong-lanceolate to oblongobovate, 20-30 cm long
   and 10-14 cm wide. The flowers are solitary, fleshy, large, conical,
   usually enclosed at first by a pair of bracts, they have 3 parted
   calyx, 3 very thick outer petals and 3 smaller, thinner inner petals.
   The fruit is ovoid or nearly round, 15-20 cm wide, set with hard,
   conical protuberances. The pulp is agreeably aromatic, abundant, yellow
   or orange, soft and fibrous. USE: Eaten raw or strained for juice.
   Extracts from the seeds are poisonous and can be used as an
   insecticide. The fruit juice is regarded as a remedy for fever and
   chills. Elsewhere it is given to relieve jaundice (probably because of
   its colour). The bark decoction is effective against dysentery and a
   tea of the inner bark is administered in cases of edema. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Soncoya. FURTHER INF: The native range
   is from southern Mexico through Central America to Columbia and
   Venezuela. It is grown in dooryards and the fruit is sold in local
   markets, though it is of mediocre quality and not popular because it is
   outwardly so hard. It needs a very warm, wet climate to flower and
   fruit. Fruits usually ripen towards late summer and early fall.
