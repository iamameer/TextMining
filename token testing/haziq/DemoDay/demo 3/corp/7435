   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect leguminous herb reaching 0.5-2.5 m in
   height. It has a taproot and a thick main stem. USES The seed is used
   as food after the bitter taste has been removed. It is used in soups,
   stews, desserts and soft drinks. It is also used in proportions up to
   15% in breadmaking. The seeds can be extracted for an oil used in
   cooking. The cooking water can be used to control pests and diseases.
   In the flowering stage the plant can be used as green manure. It can be
   used as a hedge plant, an ornamental and plant residues are used as
   fuel. KILLING T Mature plants may withstand -5Â°C, but young plants are
   frost sensitive. GROWING PERIOD Annual, with a long vegetative cycle,
   needing 150-330 days to fully ripen its seed. Usually harvested in May

   Scientific synonym: L. tauris. Seeds contain toxic alkaloids and need
   extensive preparation for human consumption. Said to be used for
   poison. New varieties with a lower alkaloid content exist. Grown at
   altitudes between 800 and 4000 m in the Andean mountains, the species
   is indigenous to western South America, mainly Peru. In Europe tarwi
   can be grown at sea level. It is nitrogen fixing but susceptible to
   excessive humidity. Optimum yield of vegetation is 50 t/ha, and yields
   of lupin seeds vary from down to 290 kg/ha in Africa to up to 4.5 t/ha
   in Australia and even up to 7 t/ha have been recorded.
