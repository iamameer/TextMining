   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall herb with a tubular stem, which branches and
   develops every year, frequently reaching over 2 m tall, while the root
   sytem may reach 40-50 cm below ground level. The leaves are 50-60 cm
   long and the inflorescence is a flat, compound umbrel. USES An
   essential oil extracted from the roots are used in perfumery, soaps and
   creams, and it has been used in the production of tobacco. It also has
   medicinal properties. The seeds and seed oil are used as flavoring
   agents in confectionery and liqueurs. The stems are used for candied
   products, and leaves are added to salads, soups and stews. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. Lovage lives for 6-8 years, but a plantation can
   usually only be maintained for 3-4 years. COMMON NAMES Lovage. FURTHER
   INF Lovage is native of the mountain regions of northern Europe. A 3-4
   year old plantation yields 6-8 t/ha of fresh root, which gives 5-6 kg
   of essential oil. The average leaf yield is 4-6 t/ha, from which 2-4 kg
   of vegetable oil can be produced. Seed yields may be 0.4-0.6 t/ha or
   3-6 kg of seed oil.
