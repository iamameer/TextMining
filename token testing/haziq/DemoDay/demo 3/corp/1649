   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A prostrate grass, vigorously spreading from rhizomes
   and stolons, forming a loose sward up to 46 cm high when ungrazed, but
   under grazing or mowing assuming a dense turf. It has an extensive and
   very deep root system. USES Very palatable and high in protein. Used
   for pasture it withstands heavy grazing. Also used for silage. It makes
   good lawns and is planted for soil conservation along roads, on
   irrigation channel banks, bunds and hills. KILLING T It tolerates an
   occasional frost of short duration, but tissue is killed below -2°C.
   The grass may however withstand -9°C during the winter period. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial grass growing spring, summer and autumn. COMMON NAMES
   Kikuyu grass, Ya-khikhuyu. FURTHER INF Kikuyu grass occurs naturally
   across the elevated plateaux of East and Central Africa, where it can
   be found between 1500-3500 m in elevation and is common on deep red,
   well-drained latosolic soils at the forest margins, and in grassy
   glades. In the subtropics, it can be found at elevations from sea
   level. Latitudinal range is between 27°N and S. It is reasonably
   drought resistant, tolerates flooding and survive fire. It doubles as a
   useful feed and harmfull weed and can especially become a weed in
   coastal areas on arable land and in irrigation channels. Dry matter
   yields may be between 9-30 t/ha.
