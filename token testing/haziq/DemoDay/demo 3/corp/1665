   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A vigorous, twining, herbaceous legume with stems up
   to 4 m long and with tickened or tuberous taproot. Dwarf forms produced
   by breeding. Red or sometimes white flowers, trifoliate leaves and up
   to 40 cm long flattened pods. USES Cultivated for its pods, seeds, and
   fleshy tap roots. Pods are cooked and seeds are usually dried. Young
   pods and dry beans can be processed as frozen or canned beans. The
   vines are also used as ornamentals. GROWING PERIOD Perennial, grown as
   an annual in temperate areas. Can be harvested for green pods 80-90
   days from sowing and for mature seeds after 100-120 days. Life span
   from 2 to severel years. COMMON NAMES Scarlet runner bean, Runner bean,

   Caraota Florida, Chiapas, Frijol Ayocote, Poroto de Espana, Poroto
   Pallar. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: P. multiflorus. Scarlet runner
   bean is considered to be indigenous to the Mexican and Central American
   highland. It can be grown at elevations from 1400-2800 m in the humid
   tropics and it does not fruit in tropical lowlands. Plants tend to drop
   flowers under dry conditions, and they are sensitive to wind. In Kenya
   it is grown at elevations between 2000-2500 m. It is growing well in
   humid areas and often interplanted with maize. In UK, yields of green
   pods are reported to average 9-14 t/ha. In Kenya, yields of dry seeds
   from smallholder production have been estimated to be about 0.9-1.5
   t/ha.
