   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium sized tree 4-25 m in height. In
   favourable situations it has a moterately straight and slender trunk up
   to 30 cm in diameter to 1/2 of the tree height. USES The wood can be
   used as fuel and for charcoal. The timber can be utilized as mine
   timber, fence posts, rail material, flooring, house timber, and pulp.
   It is a good source of honey and of pollen for bees. The leaves contain
   an essential oil with medicinal properties. The tree can be used for
   windbreaks, erosion control, and as an ornamental. Mentioned as a
   possible agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial moderately fast
   growing tree. Trees in Hawaiian plantations on favourable sites have
   average 18 m in height and 50 cm in diameter in 40 years. Withstands
   droughts of up to 4 months. COMMON NAMES Fine-veined paperbark,
   Broad-leaved paperbark, Paperbark, Tea-tree, Broad-leaved tea-tree,
   Paperbark tea-tree, Bottlebush, White bottlebush, Belbowrie, Melaleuca,
   Cajeput, Cajeput-tree, Cayeputi, Corcho, Samed, Kayuputeh, Punktree,

   FURTHER INF Paperbark is native to Australia from Sydney north along
   the coast to the Cape York peninsula in Papua New Guinea and to New
   Caledonia. In Florida it has escaped cultivation and is multiplying as
   a weed tree. In Australia the tree occurs up to 1000 m in elevation, in
   Hawaii up to 1400. It is usually found near the coast in seasonal
   swamps, along streams, in marshes and at the edges of tidal water, but
   it also occurs on well-drained slopes and upland ridges. The
   latitudinal range in Australia is about 11-34Â°S. It is fire-tolerant.
