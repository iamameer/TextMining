   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small deciduous tree often trained to a central
   lead or a delayed open center form reaching a height of 5-10 m. Fruit a
   pome, globose, ellipsoid to obovoid, usually more than 5 cm in
   diameter.
   USES The fruit can be eaten fresh, or used to make cider, soft drinks,
   juice, and vinegars. Pectine is a valuable by-product of cider. The
   wood is hard and strong and used for quality tool handles and firewood.
   KILLING T The tree may tolerate -26 to -37.5°C in the winter when fully
   dormant and -4 to -8°C in late spring, while fruits will be damaged by
   -2 to -4°C.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Begins to fruit in the 3rd year and come into
   full production from the 11th to 20th year. It may continue to fruit
   for about 100 years although the fruits may become commercially
   unprofitable. Growing 180-320 days per year.
   COMMON NAMES Apple, Pommier, Apel, Mansanas, Appoen, Pom.
   FURTHER INFO Scientific synonym, M. pumila, M. communis, Pyrus malus.
   Apple cultivars grown today apparently originated as hybrids of several
   wild species e.g. M. sylvestris, M. dasyphylla and M. pumila native to
   western Asia and the Mediterranean region. In the tropics apple does
   not do well below 1200 m in elevation and should preferably be grown
   between 1400-1800 m, depending on variety. In the tropical highland it
   can be grown in areas with a prominent change in seasons and a mild
   growing season with no extremes of sunlight, temperature or humidity.
   It requires a period of winter dormancy, in general 900-1000 hours or
   more at less than 7°C, but low chilling varieties only needs 200-300
   hours below 7.5°C. It perform best in areas with medium to low
   humidity, with long daylight hours, high light intensity and relatively
   warm days and cool nights. Windbreaks are needed for exposed sites.
   Apples are susceptible to root lesion nematodes. Fruit Yields may be up
   to 25 t/ha or higher.
