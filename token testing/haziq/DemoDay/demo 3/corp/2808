   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Large deciduous to semi-evergreen trees up to 25-30 m tall
   with impressive trunks. USE: The fruit and seed are edible. The seeds
   contain oil used for cooking and the bark fiber is used for robes. It
   can be used as an indoor plant or bonsai plant. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Baobab, Monkey Bread tree. FURTHER INF: Native
   to the deciduous tropical forests of western Madagascar. Solitary trees
   are often relics of a forest which was cleared. They were probably
   spared because they were too big to chop down. The climate of the trees
   native ecoregion is tropical, with temperatures ranging from a mean
   maximum of 30-33°C and a mean minimum of 8-21°C. In its native region
   there is a wet and a dry season, with most of the rainfall from October
   to April. Precipitation declines from an annual average of around 1500
   mm in the north to around 1000 mm in the south of the region. The
   ecoregion occupies the rain shadow on the western side of the central
   highlands of Madagascar and has a relatively long, pronounced dry
   season. Seedlings and young trees need a protected light shaded site,
   whereas older trees thrive in full sunlight. One of the six species of
   baobabs endemic from Madagascar, perhaps the better known of Malagasy
   baobabs. Occurs in the western part of the Island. It is the largest
   baobab species on the island.
