   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is deciduous tree reaching 20-25 m in height, with a
   girth of 1.5-3 m. The bole is slender and older trees have very small,
   low, sharp buttresses. In the forest, the crown is fairly small, thin
   and rounded, becoming flat when old, but it tends to spread when in the
   open. Flowers are pinkish-cream turning to orange and are densely
   crowded in spikelike racemes 5-20 cm long. Fruit is very persistent,
   hanging at the ends of branches on stout stalks 25 cm long. It is
   shiny, glabrous, dark purple-brown, usually slightly curved, 15-25 cm
   long by about 5 cm across, with 4 longitudinal, winglike ridges nearly
   3 cm broad. USE: The fruit pulp is rich in sugars and may be used in
   flavouring food. The timber is reddish to brown, fairly hard heartwood
   and white sapwood. Tannin is obtainable from the fruit pulp. Leaves,
   bark, roots and the kernels are used for medicinal purposes. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: aidan tree. FURTHER INF: It is common
   on the fringe of the West African rainforest belt. Trees are widespread
   in tropical Africa, in forest, especially secondary forest, and they
   are at their best in the rainforest. The species is found throughout
   the high forest zone, in riverian forest, in the southern
   savannah-woodland and in the forest outliers in the African plains.
