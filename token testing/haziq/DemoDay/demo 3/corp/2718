   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A dense or straggly, somewhat spiny shrub or small
   tree reaching a height of up to 2-10 m, with a strong coppicing
   capacity. USES It can be used for forage and the seeds are a good
   source of protein for cattle and can also be used as food. The wood can
   be used for fuel. It is good for low windbreaks and will withstand
   clipping. It can be used for sand dune stabilization, and it is a good
   source of pollen for bees. The branches and twigs exude a clear gum.
   GROWING PERIOD Moderately fast-growing an short-lived perennial. The
   lifespan is probably 10-15 years. COMMON NAMES
   Prickly wattle, Bramble wattle, Elegant wattle, Gundabluey, Royal
   acacia, Acacia bush, Pin bush, Narran, Bohemia. FURTHER INF Prickly
   wattle can be found throughout the arid and semi-arid regions of
   Australia, within the latitudinal range 14-36Â°S at elevations between
   50-750 m. It is most common on plains and gentle slopes, and is
   frequent in the sand soils along watercourses. It can also be found on
   stony ridges and coastal dunes. It might be a potential weed in high
   rainfall areas.
