   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a semi-deciduous to deciduous tree up to 7 m tall
   with an open crown. Bark on young branches green and hairy but dark
   grey-brown and longitudinally fissured on older branches and stems,
   smooth on spines formed from modified side shoots. USE: Fruit and seeds
   are edible. Leaves and fruits can be used as feed. The flowers are a
   valuable honey source. Wood used as firewood and the bark yields fibre.
   Bark, roots and leaves have medicinal properties. The plant is widely
   used for sand dune stabilization and soil conservation. Useful for
   revegetation, intercropping, as an ornamental and as living fence. The
   roots fixes atmospheric nitrogen and the leaves , rich in nutrients,
   are frequently used as a green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Chinese lantern tree, marabou thorn, sicklebush
   (English). FURTHER INF: It penetrates clear-cut areas far into the
   rainforest zone. In Malaysia, it occurs in areas with strong seasonal
   climate, usually on poor, occasionally clayey soils, in brushwood,
   thickets, hedges, teak forest and grassland. Forms dense hammocks on
   lateritic soils in Senegal and Sudan, while in India it occurs in dry
   deciduous forest. It can be an indicator of overgrazing in low rainfall
   areas. Usually not frost resistant and tolerance is less on poor soils,
   but definitely drought resistant. It is fire resistant and does not
   tolerate waterlogging. Best growth occurs on deep, sandy loamy soils
   and it can tolerate a wide pH range.
