   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tufted grass, 45-180 cm high. USES It is palatable
   when young, unpalatable when mature. It is best grazed when 70% of the
   grass is green, that is for a period of four weeks during the short
   rains. It should be cut for hay at the stage of maximum dry-matter
   production, which is after about eight week's growth during the long
   rainy season. It persists best when cut at the end of the growing
   season. GROWING PERIOD Slow growing perennial grass. COMMON NAMES Red
   oat grass, Kangaroo grass, Merakan lanang, Bagokbok, Samsamon,
   Ipatpatey, Sbo':w. Hnnaz feek, Ya-faek, Co' bong cao ru'ng khop, Co'tam
   hung. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: T. australis, T. imberbis.
   Dominant in the extensive Acacia-grasslands between 1200-2000 m in East
   Africa and widespread in grassland and in open woodlands on clay. It
   can be found at elevations between sea level and 3000 m in Africa and
   has been recorded at above 3000 m in the Himalayans. It has some
   drought resistance, responds well to dry-season burning, but will not
   tolerate flooding. Dry matter yields are usually between 0.5-5 t/ha.
