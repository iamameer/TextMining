   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a slow-growing broadleaf, evergreen tree or shrub
   reaching 3-12 m in height. Stem is generally crooked wood intensely
   hard, the branches knotty and bark deeply furrowed. The dense crown of
   close-growing foliage gives the tree a rounded, compact, net
   appearance. Each leaf is composed of 2 or 3 pairs of smooth, stalkless
   leaflets arranged on a slender mid-rib. The leaflets are 6-13 cm in
   length. Beautiful blue flowers grow in great profusion and almost cover
   the tree and remain for a long time. As the older blooms fade from deep
   blue to paler shades, some becoming almost white, a striking
   variegation of colour is produced. USE: The great strength and tenacity
   of the timber, combined with the self-lubricating properties due to the
   resin content, make this wood especially adapted for bearing
   underwater. The most important use for it is for bearing lining the
   stern tubes of propeller shafts. Resin obtained from the wood and bark
   is used in powder, pill and tincture. Apothecaries use shavings and
   raspings of the wood for medicinal purposes, in the same way the bark
   is employed for medicine. Resin is applied to the tooth for a
   toothache, and applied externally for rheumatism. For gout, blood
   pressure and arteriosclerosis resin is taken orally. It is distinctly
   ornamental on a lawn. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Lignum-vitae tree. FURTHER INF: The tree is native of the Caribbean,
   Central America and Mexico. It has been introduced into India and
   Ghana. It also grows in the arid plains stretching form the Florida
   Keys of USA to Venezuela. It can be found in lowland dry forest,
   woodland, and thicket. It frequently grows in coastal areas.
