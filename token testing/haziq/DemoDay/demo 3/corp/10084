   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A slender, erect herb reaching 60-80 cm in height in
   natural stands and up to 120 cm under cultivation, with a vigorous
   rhizome and shallow root system. Leaves oval-elliptic, 3-6.5 x 0.8-1.9
   cm. USES A sweetener, mainly stevioside, can be extracted from the
   dried leaves. It can be used as a herbal remedy for diabetes. The
   sweetener can also be used to increase the sweetening intensity of
   other agents like fructose or to lower the caloric value of a
   sweetener. It is used in pickles, dried seafood, flavorings and
   confectioneries. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. First harvest may take place
   2 months after planting, which is about 6 months after sowing. The
   following harvests are taken at intervals of 1 months and may continue
   for a period of about 5 years. COMMON NAMES Stevia, Kaa He'e, Ya wan.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Eupatorium rebaudianum. Stevia
   originates from north-eastern Paraguay and south-eastern Brazil and is
   now also cultivated in eastern Asia. It occurs naturally in subtropical
   regions on the edges of marshes or in grassland up to 700 m of
   elevation. In the tropics it can be grown at altitudes up to 1500 m.
   Flowering under the critical photoperiod of 12 hours occurs 40-60 days
   after sowing or cutting. Long days, however, promote leaf production
   resulting in a higher content of stevioside, on dry-matter basis. In
   Japan, the yield in the first year is 400-500 kg/ha of dried leaves,
   while yields in the following years vary between 1.5-2 t/ha of dry
   leaves. In western Java a yearly production of 3 t/ha of dry leaves is
   possible.
