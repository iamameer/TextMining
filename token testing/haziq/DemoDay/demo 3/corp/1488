   synonym: M. bracreata, M. litoralis. Indian mulberry is probably native
   of Queensland, Australia. It can now be found within the latitudinal
   range 30°N to 30°S. It is commonly found in humid and seasonal climates
   at elevations up to 1500 m. It occurs in forests, and as a pioneer
   after cultivation, bush-fires, deforestation or vulcanic activity. It
   is persistent and very tolerant. The ability of the seeds to float
   explains its wide distribution and occurrence on many sea-shores. Yield
   of bark is reported to be 500-1000 kg/ha.
