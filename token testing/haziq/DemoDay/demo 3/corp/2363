   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, much branched, aromatic herb reaching a
   height of 30-100 cm. USES Young leaves can be eaten raw as a vegetable
   side-dish or used as flavouring. The nutlets swell in water into a
   gelatinous mass often used in sweet cooling drinks. It has several
   medicinal properties. An essential oil can be extracted and used in
   soap and cosmetics. The plant contains citral, camphor, and
   methyl-cinnamate. GROWING PERIOD Annual. Usually germinating 1-2 weeks
   after sowing, flowering after 8-12 weeks and maturing seeds after 14-20
   weeks. Harvest may start 2-3 months after sowing. COMMON NAMES Hoary
   basil, American basil, Camphor basil, Ocimum Camphor, Kemangi,
   Serawung, Selasih putih, Selaseh, Ruku-ruku, Maenglak. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: O. canum, O. africanum, O. brachiatum. Hoary basil
   occurs wild and cultivated throughout tropical Africa and tropical
   Asia. It is often found growing on roadsides, in fields, in teak
   forests, and in open waste places. It prefers sunny, wind-sheltered
   spots. It occurs at elevations between sea level and 500 m or even up
   to 2000 m. An average yield is 2-3 t/ha of dried leaves annually,
   giving 25-40 kg solid camphor. However, higher yields are possible
   through manuring. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
