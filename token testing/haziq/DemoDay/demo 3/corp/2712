   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub of about 1 m to a small to medium-sized spiny
   deciduous or nearly evergreen tree usually 4-15 m tall but may reach 20
   m in height. Tall trees have a withspreading flat-topped crown. USES
   The wood can be used for fenceposts, small implements and as fuel and
   charcoal. The protein-rich pods, and leaves are eaten by livestock.
   Plants survive heavy grazing. The trees provide shade, sand dune
   stabilization and it can be used as ornamentals. It produces a gum that
   is said to be edible. KILLING T Frost tender espesially when young.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Can be grown on a 10 years fuelwood rotation.
   COMMON NAMES Umbrella thorn, Karamoja, Seyal, Sayal, Samor, Seing,
   Babool, Haaken-steekdoring, Djelcki, Djilouki, Guanaki, Tili, Afadar,
   Afadjadj, Afaggag, Samr, Saganeib, Ullaf, Kura, Eluwo, Etir, Ewoi,
   Entepesi, Ol-Gorete, Mgunga, Mosu, Mosunyana, Kandili, Sambreeldoring,
   Israeli babool, Tortillis, Bisaw. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: A.
   raddiana, A. spirocarpa, A. fasciculata, A. heteracantha. Four distinct
   subspecies of umbrella thorn are known in different ecological zones:
   "tortilis" (Sahel and Middle East), "raddiana" (Sudan, Middel East, and
   Sahel), "spirocarpa" (Eastern Africa and Sudan), "heteracantha"
   (southern Africa). The tree can be found at elevations between sea
   level and 1000 m. It occur naturally within the latitudinal range of
   15-30Â°N. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. A 12-year-old
   plantation, 3x3 m spacing, can yield 54 t/ha of fuelwood. Best adapted
   to hot, dry lowland conditions, the tree is drought hardy, but often
   found by temporary or permanent waterholes and around wells. It often
   indicates the tree limit towards the desert. The tree should not be
   introduced to new areas, with more humid climates, where grazing and
   firewood are in adequate supply, as it is likely that the species will
   grow out of control and become a nuisance. It seems that at times the
   leaves may be toxic.
