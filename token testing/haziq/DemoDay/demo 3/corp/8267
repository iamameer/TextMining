   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A shortly rhizomatous, erect, tussocky grass, with robust,
   glabrous, branching culms up to 1.5-1.8 m high. Leaf-blades about 46 cm
   long and 13 mm wide, bluish, glaucous, usually fleshy leaves with
   strong white midribs. USE: Very palatable. Mostly used as grazed
   pasture, it withstands heavy grazing when established but should be
   grazed lightly for the first six months down to 7.5 cm. Larger types
   are suitable for cut-and-carry. Makes good hay and silage.
   Stoloniferous types are ideal for erosion control. GROWING PERIOD:
   Summer-growing perennial. COMMON NAMES: Makarikari grass, Makarikari
   panicum. FURTHER INF: It is native of Botswana, now cultivated and
   widely naturalised elsewhere, including northern NSW and Queensland in
   Australia. Native to areas with an annual rainfall of 500-700 mm and
   cultivated in areas with 400-1000 mm. Occurs around 20°S and 1000 m,
   with an average annual temperature of about 22°C. Found on seasonally
   waterlogged or flooded heavy clays, often with significant salinity, of
   low to high fertility. Yields of 8-23 (commonly about 12) t/ha DM have
   been recorded.
