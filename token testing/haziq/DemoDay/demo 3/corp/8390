   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree attaining a height of 12-20 m. The
   crown is open containing relatively few branches that often begin quite
   near the ground. Flowers pale-violet to blue-purple, slenderly
   campanulate, up to 6 cm long. USE: It is the lightest wood grown in
   China (specific gravity 0.3 g/cubic m) used for music instruments,
   models, glider construction and sculptures. The leaves, flowers, fruits
   and roots have medicinal properties. The tree is used for shelter
   belts, as an ornamental and its rooting ability and its tolerance of
   rocky, disturbed and relatively infertile soils makes it useful in
   reclamation of surface mines. It is suited for intercropping with
   wheat, cotton and maize, the resulting yields of wheat have been
   measured to 16% higher, those of cotton 7% higher, and those of maize
   more than 11% higher than those from plots without the tree. KILLING T
   Moderately frost resistant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial deciduous tree.
   COMMON NAMES Kiri. FURTHER INF: The tree occur naturally within the
   latitudinal range of 32-40°N. It is drought hardy and tolerates salt
   winds. Requires wide spacing. Annual wood production potential is 25-35
   m3/ha. It prefers a warm temperate to warm climate. It flourish at
   daytime temperatures of 24-30°C and its height growth ceases at daytime
   temperatures of 15-20°C. Sufficient ventilation of the soil is vital,
   on poorly draining sites, after 3-5 days of uninterrupted rainfall it
   casts off its leaves and dies. It may be damaged by wind. It is a
   pioneer species, colonizing disturbed areas such as roadsides, mined
   areas, sanitary landfills, abandoned agricultural soils, and deep,
   moist but well-drained alluvial soils along waterways.
