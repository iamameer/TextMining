   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized tree reaching 20-30 m in height, with
   a straight trunk, 5-8 m tall and 60-180 cm in diameter, often
   buttressed. The tree has large alternate lobed leaves, milky latex, and
   grapefruit-sized or larger composite fruits, each weighing 400-1200 g.
   It is evergreen in the ever-wet tropics, deciduous in monsoon
   countries. The seedless varieties (breadfruits) usually have fruits
   with a pebbled surface, while the fruits of the seedy varieties
   (breadnuts) often are covered with short stubby pines. USES The edible
   fruits are used as a vegetable and the seeds are eaten boiled or
   roasted. The fruit is a source of vitamins A and B, starch, and
   calcium, it is eaten cooked, boiled, baked, roasted, or fried.
   Fermented fruit is made into a cheese-like paste, which is formed to
   cakes and baked. For longterm storage it can be cooked and dried. The
   bark provides a fiber and the latex are used for caulking boats, as a
   glue to catch birds, as a chewing gum and it also has medicinal
   properties. Leaves and fallen fruit are fed to livestock. The wood is
   used for canoes, surfboards, toys and light constructions. Trees
   provide shade and shelter and are grown as ornamentals. Mentioned as a
   useful agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Short-lived perennial. Bear
   fruit when 3-6 years old. The fruit should be picked while still firm,
   about 60-90 days after fruit set. The main cropping season lasts about
   120 days. COMMON NAMES Breadfruit, Breadnut, Arbol del pan, Masa pan,
   Arbre a pain, Arvore do pao, Fruta pao, Albero del pane, Brotbaum,
   Saake, Sakee, Sa-ke, Sukun, Rimas, Uto, Fruta de pan, Kelur, Kelor,

   Scientific synonym: A. communis, A. indica, A. incisa, A. camansi.
   Breadfruit is indigenous to the Polynesian region. It require warm,
   humid, tropical conditions and thrives at elevations below 600 m, but
   can be found up to about 2000 m and does not thrive far from the sea.
   It grows best in a relative humidity from 70-90% and occurs within the
   latitudinal range 23°N-17°S. Young trees grow better under shade but
   later full sun is required. The trees shed their leaves under dry
   conditions and are said to shed the fruit when the soil is excessively
   wet. Cultivars differ greatly in their tolerance of adverse conditions
   and there are cultivars that cope well with shallow, calcareous soils,
   brackish water and salt sprays. Optimal yields of 0.7-3.5 t or up to
   700 fruits per tree can be expected from a mature tree. In the South
   Pacific, average yields may be 50-150 fruits per tree, in India 200
   fruits and in Barbados the yields may be 16-30 t/ha.
