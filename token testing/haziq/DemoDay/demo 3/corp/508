   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with a short
   bole and spreading crown, attaining a height of up to 15 m and diameter
   of 50 cm. In dry, miscellaneous forests, the size is much smaller. The
   bark is light brownish grey, smooth to slightly fissured and scaly.
   Leaves often broader than long, 6-16 cm diameter. USE: The leaves,
   flowers and flower buds are eaten as vegetables. Leaves make good
   fodder. The wood is used as fuel and the bark render fibre, tannin and
   gum. The seeds yield a fatty oil. The bark decoction is used for
   diarrhoea control, as an astringent alternative and for treating
   scrofula, skin diseases and ulcers. The showy fragrant, pink, purple or
   white flowers make the tree attractive for an ornamental and for avenue
   plantings. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: orchid tree.
   FURTHER INF: It is a plant of tropical and subtropical climates with
   hot, dry summers and mild winters. It demands plenty of light and
   requires good drainage. Severe frost kills the leaves of seedlings and
   saplings, but they recover during summer. The tree is fairly resistant
   to drought but susceptible to fires. It is capable of growing on a wide
   range of soils from gravelly, shallow, rocky soil on hill slopes to
   sandy loam and loamy soil in the valley.
