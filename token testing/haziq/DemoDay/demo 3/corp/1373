   suey. Shoots, flower buds, flowers, and young leaves are cooked and
   eaten as greens. Young fruits of sweet cultivars may be eaten raw like
   cucumbers and small fruits can be pickled. The fruits and leaves also
   have medicinal properties. The seeds yield an edible oil. GROWING

   acutangula. Angled loofah probably originated in India where wild forms
   still occur. It is well adapted for the growing conditions in the
   tropical lowlands at elevations less than 500 m. Excessive rain may
   reduce flowering and fruiting. In seasonal climates dry-season planting
   is more successful than wet-season planting. About 15-20 fruits may be
   produced per plant. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
   Photosynthesis pathway C3.
