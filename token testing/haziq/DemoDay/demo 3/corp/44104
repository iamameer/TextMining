   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a shortly deciduous tree usually reaching 9-12 m in
   height but can become up to 21 m tall. Trunk and branches grey,
   sometimes set with short, sharp prickles. The flowers, which are
   produced before the leaves, are borne in large clusters at the end of
   the thick stalks. They are orange-scarlet with a tinge of terra cotta
   or cream coloured. USE: becomes increasingly important as a protein
   supplement (for example the palatable stems) during the dry periods
   when pasture grasses are scarce and of low nutritive value. The tree is
   a good source of firewood. The seeds are said to be poisonous. Trees
   are planted for soil conservation, as living fences and ornamentals. It
   can fixes atmospheric nitrogen and usually drop the leaves during the
   dry periods, and these act as a mulch. GROWING PERIOD: Fast-growing
   perennial. COMMON NAMES: coast erythrina, coral tree, lucky bean.
   FURTHER INF: It is a tree of coastal districts. It is a tree of the
   wooded stream banks. It is fairly drought resistant and will stand
   several degrees of frost. Where frosts are heavy, it may grow but will
   not flower well.
