   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A spiny, normally evergreen tree usually reaching
   4-10 m in height, but occasionally attaining 21 m with a main trunk up
   to 1 m in diameter. Leaves entire and laceolate, flowers greenish and
   the fruit a greenish-yellow, ovoid drupe. USES The kernels are a source
   of an edible oil. The oil is also used for illumination and soap. Sun
   dried oil cake residue may be fed to livestock, but is not accepted by
   horses and should not be fed to dairy cattle. Foliage and fallen fruits
   are eaten by livestock. The timber is very hard, heavy and durable,
   suitable for agricultural implements and building poles and makes a
   good charcoal. The tree can be planted as a shade tree and for soil
   conservation and windbreaks. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Trees may start
   to bear when 5-6 years old and reach maximum production at 60 years.
   They are long-lived and trees may become up to 200-400 years old.
   COMMON NAMES Argan. FURTHER INF Synonym: Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels.
   Argan is native of southwestern Marocco. It can be found at elevations
   between sea level and 1500 m. It is drought resistant but not adapted
   to drifting sands. It can shed the foliage and remain in a state of
   dormancy for several years during prolonged droughts. Average fruit
   yield may be about 8 kg per tree.
