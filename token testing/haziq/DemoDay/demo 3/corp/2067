   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a large deciduous or practically evergreen tree, up
   to 40-60 m tall and 5 m in girth, bole cylindrical, long and straight
   with large, flat buttresses, 6 m above the soil surface; crown open,
   generally flattened, consisting of a few whorled branches. Leaves
   simple, alternate, in tufts at the ends of the branches. USE: It has
   potential importance in paper making. The timber is used in plywood
   manufacture, furniture, joinery, for plinths, mouldings, general
   fittings, and door faces and, after suitable treatment, for external
   joinery. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Afara. FURTHER INF:
   Afara can be found at elevations from sea level to 500 m. The
   latitudinal range of natural occurrence is 10°N-6°S. Planted at Hawaii
   at 22°N. It is essentially a tree of deciduous forest and sheds its
   leaves in the dry season. It is characteristic of tropical high
   secondary forest areas with a dry season of about 4 months, but it does
   not respond well to long dry spells, especially on sandy soils. The
   species is especially plentiful at some distance from the coast, but it
   gains at the expense of the rainforest following clearances. The tree
   will withstand occasional flooding. It is very fire sensitive. It grows
   best on rich, well-drained alluvial soils, but is also found on other
   types such as lateritic sands, gravel and clays, lava, black basaltic
   clays and crystalline soils. It requires wide spacing. Annual wood
   production potential is 10-14 m3/ha.
