   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a spreading deciduous or evergreen tree, 6-10 m in
   height, with a domed crown. Trunk erect, stout, uniquely swollen at the
   base, which may grow to 4 m in diameter, spreading above the ground so
   that the tree appears to be standing on a mound. Leaves simple
   alternate, typical of the family, appearing as terminal whorls. USE:
   Leaves are used as fodder in times of drought. However, fruits should
   be considered potentially toxic to livestock. The seeds, leaf and root
   contain saponins. The fruit has been used as a human emetic and
   purgative; an infusion of the leaves also acts as a purgative. The tree
   is planted as an unusual ornamental around Nairobi and elsewhere in the
   highlands of Kenya and provides excellent shade. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: bella sombra, belombra, pokeweed. FURTHER INF:
   It is a tree for mild climates, undemanding in soil fertility and
   resistant to sea winds. The tree is reputed to grow rapidly to its
   preferred height but is fairly aggressive in gardens, with root suckers
   appearing readily above the soil. It is resistant to locusts and ants
   and will withstand hurricanes and prolonged heat and drought.
