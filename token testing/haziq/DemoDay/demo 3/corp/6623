   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an often evergreen bushy tree usually 4-7 m in
   height, sometimes reaching 10-25 m. It is much branched with a
   cylindrical trunk. Crown is golden-green, deep and spreading with fine
   almost whorled branches. Bole is often rather angular and forked.
   Leaves opposite, simple, ovate or ovate elliptic, 6-20 x 3-10 cm,
   glossy and dark green. USE: It is a source of firewood and charcoal.
   Sap is used in the treatment of scabies and as an anthelmintic
   (tapeworms), while leaves are used as a remedy for hemorrhages,
   diarrhoea, gonorrhoea, sore throats, headaches and fevers. Resin from
   the flower stalks is believed to ease colic and to check infection
   after childbirth, while a decoction of the bark is drunk as a remedy
   for malaria or jaundice. Roots are used to hasten breast development in
   young women while roots and bark are boiled in water, and the infusion
   drunk twice a day, to interrupt the menses. Young leaves are sometimes
   used a medicine for asthma and fruits are occasionally used in cases of
   abortion in the belief that the red juice averts bleeding. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: blood tree, orange-milk tree. FURTHER
   INF: It occurs at medium to low altitudes in evergreen forest, at
   forest margins, clearings and along river and stream banks. It is a
   common and widely distributed tree from the Sudan to South Africa,
   often a pioneer when a forest has been cleared. The trees have a
   general brownish-yellow appearance in the field.
