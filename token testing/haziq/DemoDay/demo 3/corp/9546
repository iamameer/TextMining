   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized evergreen glabrous tree with
   slender hanging branchlets. The tree can reach a height of 13-20 m and
   a girth of 1-2.5 m. USES An essential oil is extracted form its roots
   and heartwood. The oil is used in perfumes, cosmetics, and soaps and it
   also has medicinal properties. Tree chips are made into incense and the
   wood is carved into art objects. ROWING PERIOD Perennial. Flowers 3-4
   years after planting and fully mature at 60-80 years. COMMON NAMES
   Indian sandalwood, East Indian sandalwood, Chandana, Chandan, Chandal,
   Sandal, Gandada, Gandha, Suket, Chandanam, Santhanam, Srigandam,
   Chandana, Santagu, Shrikhand. FURTHER INF Indian sandalwood is native
   of southern India, Sri Lanka and the Malay Archipelago. In India, it
   can be found at elevations between sea level and 2500 m, but flourishes
   best between 600 and 1000-1500 m. Sandalwood is said to be an obligate
   parasite and most therefore be associated with suitable hosts, if it is
   to survive. However, there have been suggestions that sandalwood is not
   necessarily an obligate parasite. Many of the species that have been
   identified as hosts of sandalwood are capable of fixing nitrogen.
   Trials have shown that host plants should not be further away than 2.2
   m from the sandalwood.
