   Ecocrop code 10626

   Notes
   Habitat: It is usually found in undulating grass-veld (savanna).
   Environment: It can grow in regions where few conventional crops can
   survive and is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions.
   Temperature: Temperatures sometimes reach 50°C in its native habitat.
   Reported temperature range for growth is 16-50°C with the optimum
   between 22-30°C.
   Water: It can grow in areas where rainfall is so slight and erratic
   that in some years almost no rain falls at all. In its habitat surface
   water is usually available only for 8 weeks a year, though in the
   fine-grained sandy soils water may remain in the root zone for as long
   as 2 months after a rainfall. Reported annual rainfall range for growth
   is 150-800 mm with the optimum between 300-600 mm. The plant probably
   survives droughts by drawing on water stored in the tuber, which
   shrinks greatly in dry years.
   Soil: Physical: In deep, loose, sandy soils the plant sometimes forms
   characteristic "craters" where the soil is stony. These hollows,
   sometimes more than 1 m across, are often ringed with stones that
   appear to have been forced to the surface by the tuber beneath. In some
   areas, marama bean occurs in scattered stands several kilometres
   across.
   Chemical: Soil pH range for growth is estimated to 5.5-7.5 with the
   optimum between 6-7.
