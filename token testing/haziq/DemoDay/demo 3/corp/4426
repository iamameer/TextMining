   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A deciduous or evergreen tree reaching a height of
   8-17 m in the wild, but under cultivation it is much smaller. Under
   unfavourable conditions it may only be a multi-stemmed shrub. The pod
   may be up to 30 cm long and contain up to 18 seeds. USES Carob gum is
   the whitish powder obtained from grinding the endosperm of the seeds.
   The gum has extensive use in the food industry. It stabilizes ice
   cream, is used in the preparation of cheeses and extruded meat
   products, improves the water retention properties of drughs, and is
   used as an emulsifier and stabilizer in dressings and sauces. It is
   also used in the textile and paper-making industries and it is used in
   drilling mud to control the water losses and mud viscosity. The seeds
   can be used as a coffee substitute and the pods can be fed to
   livestock. The workable wood is used to make furniture and carts.
   KILLING T
   The tree tolerates short periods at -7°C, but dies after long periods
   of -4 to -5°C. Young trees are more easily damaged. GROWING PERIOD
   Long-lived perennial. Begins to bear pods from the 6th or 7th year (5th
   or 6th when budded). After flowering, the fruit requires 180-240 days
   to mature. May live for 100 years or more. COMMON NAMES Carob,
   St.John`s bread, Locust Bean, Algarroba, Caroubier, Kharoubah, Caroube,
   Kharuv, Carruba. FURTHER INF Carob is heat and fire resistant, windfirm
   and termite resistant, it tolerates salt winds, and drought. It
   requires wide spacing, has a penetrating root system, and is slow
   growing. Grown at altitudes between sea level and 1000 m. Humidity
   should be moderate in winter and low in summer. The species is
   indigenous to the Middle-East and was traditionally grown within the
   latitudinal range 27-42°N. Non irrigated and grown in semiarid regions,
   the optimum yield of pods is 7 t/ha, whereas trees that are irrigated
   or grown in high rainfall areas may yield up to 12 t/ha. The trees are
   often planted on hillsides above orange groves. Dew is a limiting
   climatic factor. Frequent wetting of the leaves enhances the spread of
   leaf diseases and the tree fails as a commercial crop in areas with
   more than 220 dew nights per year. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species.
