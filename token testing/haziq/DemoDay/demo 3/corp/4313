   BRIEF DESCRIPTION Fast-growing deciduous tree with simple leaves, erect
   catkins. Fruit 1-3 nuts, brown, coriaceous, in a swollen, spiny cupule
   which dehisces irregularly by 2-3 valves. The American chestnuts is
   bigger and sweeter than Chinese and European chestnuts. USES The nuts
   are eaten raw, roasted, boiled or dried, or ground and prepared into
   soup, chocolates, pastries, etc. The light, soft timber is durable and
   used for fencing, gates, furniture, poles, paneling, etc. Bark and wood
   extracts used for tanning leather. KILLING T Flowers will not tolerate
   frost. GROWING PERIOD Perennial, require 2 years to bearing for grafted
   seedlings, and 8 years for ungrafted seedlings. COMMON NAMES American
   chestnut. FURTHER INF American chestnut is native to USA, east of the
   Mississippi River. It is adapted to low to medium humidity in summer,
   and medium to high in winter. The commercial potential of the tree as a
   source of timber and nuts has been seriously affected by chestnut
   blight, a fungal disease. Trees usually reach about 4-6 m in height
   before the blight visibly affects their growth and they rarely survive
   to produce substantial yields.
