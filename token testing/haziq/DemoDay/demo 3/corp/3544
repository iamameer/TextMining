   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a spreading, low-growing, evergreen subshrub
   reaching 20-50 cm in height. Herbaceous flowering stems rise above the
   woody, decumbent portion of the plant. USE: It provides nutritious
   forage for livestock and wildlife species throughout its range. Its
   persistent leaves are an important winter food source. It is
   particularly important for sheep because it provides the minimum
   nutritional requirement for maintenance of gestating ewes. It has an
   extensive, highly branched root system, and tolerates poor site
   conditions. It is used to stabilize soils and to reclaim disturbed
   sites. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Gardner saltbush.
   FURTHER INF: It is most common on saline, poorly developed, or clay
   soils with a pH of 7.8 to 8.6. Soils are typically low in available
   phosphorous, nitrogen, and potassium. It also grows on sodic, silty, or
   sandy soils. Sites are usually harsh and arid, with widely fluctuating
   temperatures and high winds.
