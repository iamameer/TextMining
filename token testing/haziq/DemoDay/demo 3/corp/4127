   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A robust, tall, erect herb reaching a height of up to
   1-5 m. USES The plant provides fibre from the stems, oil from the
   seeds, and narcotics from the leaves and flowers. Generally the plant
   is grown for fibre in temperate areas and for drugs in the tropics. The
   fibers is used as a substitute for flax in the manifacture of yarns and
   twines. The drying oil is used as a substitute for linseed oil in
   paints and varnishes. The plant yields three types of narcotics. Bhang,
   or hashish, is the dried leaves and flower shoots from the male and
   female plants. Ganja is the dried unfertilized female inflorescences of
   speciel cultivars grown in India. Charas is the crude resin collected
   from the tops of the plants. KILLING T A temperature of 0Â°C for a long
   duration may kill the plant. GROWING PERIOD Annual, require 90-150 days
   for the production of fiber and up to 170 days to mature seeds.
   Harvesting for fiber is done when the plants first flower. COMMON NAMES
   Indian Hemp, Italian hemp, Russian hemp, Soft hemp, Marihuana, Chanvre,
   Canamo. FURTHER INF Hemp is indigenous to central Asia or China. Heavy
   winds tend to lodge the crop. Optimum yield of hemp fibre is more than
   2.0 t/ha, average yield 0.65 t/ha and a good yield of seed is about 1.0
   t/ha, average 0.45 t/ha. For the production of narcotic resin, warm
   weather and tropical conditions are required.
