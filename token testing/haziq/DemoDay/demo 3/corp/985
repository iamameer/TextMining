   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A coarse grass branching at the base, 30-60 cm tall,
   the culms ascending or prostrate. It has a particularly tough root
   system and is hard to pull out. USES Used for pasture, it should be
   eaten when young, later the foliage becomes very tough. It can be made
   into coarse hay or silage. Can also be used for stabilizing sandy
   soils. In India, the seeds are eaten in times of food scarcity. The
   seedlings are eaten as vegetable and the grass can be used to make
   mats. GROWING PERIOD Summer-growing annual grass. COMMON NAMES Goose
   grass, Crow's foot grass, Grama de caballo, Pata de gallina, Rapoka
   grass, Crab grass, Indian goose grass, Kavoronaisivi, Mangrasi, Fowl
   foot grass, Yardgrass, Fowl-foot grass. FURTHER INF Goose grass is a
   worldwide weed of the tropics and subtropics, the seeds are spread in
   the manure from the livestock. It can occasionally contain hydrocyanic
   acid and be toxic to calves and sheep. In the tropics, it can be found
   from sea level to about 2000 m in elevation and is common in disturbed
   land, waste places, along roadsides and in nitrogen-rich soils. It is
   drought resistant. Yields of up to 30 t/ha of fresh herbage have been
   reported.
