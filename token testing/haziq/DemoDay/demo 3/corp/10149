   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A fine-stemmed, many-branched, and tap-rooted leguminous
   sub-shrub, prostrate to semi-erect, 20-80 cm tall. Leaves trifoliolate,
   leaflets lanceolate, 20-55 mm long, 10-19 mm wide. Flowers, small,
   yellow. USE: Used as forage in permanent pastures on poor soils.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Stylosanthes. FURTHER INF: It
   is native of the sub-humid and dryland areas of central and eastern
   Brazil from about 12-20ºS, and 38-50ºW with annual average temperature
   from 21-25ºC. It has potential application in more tropical
   environments. Occurs in areas with 1000-1700 mm rainfall/year and 5-6
   month dry season, in areas receiving less than 1000 mm and having more
   than 6 month dry season and more humid coastal areas with more than
   1900 mm rainfall and a less well-defined dry season. Mostly found on
   sandy soils in savannas and heavier soils in the caatinga. Adapted to
   low-fertility oxisols and ultisols with a pH between 4-6. Dry matter
   yields mostly in the range, 3-6 t/ha, although yields up to 14 t/ha DM
   are quoted.
