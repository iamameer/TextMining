   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall, large crowned evergreen tree reaching a
   height of 30-35 m or in exceptional cases 50 m with a diameter above
   the buttresses of 150-250 cm. At maturity the crown is flattish with
   large spreadings limbs. Leaves oblong to elliptic, 10-15 x 3-6 cm.
   Fruits usually elliptic, 9-14 x 5-11 mm with 2 well developed papery
   wings. USE It has a good potential for reafforestaion of swampy lowland
   tropical areas. The timber is used for light constructions, mouldings,
   interior furnishing, shortfiber pulp, veneer, plywood and package.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. When harvested at 18-20 years it can be
   expected to yield 200-300 m3/ha from a fully stocked stand of 150-250
   stems/ha. In the Solomon Islands a 20 year old stand with 80-100
   logs/ha was estimated at 120-150 m3/ha. COMMON NAMES Swamp oak, Dafo,
   Brown terminalia, Swamp talis, Kopika, Pepeo, Goba, Bairi, Homba, Peo,
   Leqara, Ghombasau, Aghomba, Nuli, Maranuri. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: T. kajewskii. Swamp oak can be found naturally growing on
   Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands at elevations from sea level
   to 600 m. The latitudinal range of natural occurrence is 4-10Â°S. It is
   usually found on low-lying poorly drained sites, in fresh water swamps
   and in stream valleys but can also be found scattered in drier vallys.
   Seedlings can withstand violent flooding and often establish beside
   rivers. It is a pioneer species, requiring plenty of light at the time
   of establishment.
