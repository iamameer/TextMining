   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION It is commonly a small tree of 8-20 m, but it can
   become up to 30 m tall and reach 1 m in diameter. On shallow, dry soils
   it can be reduced to 2-3 m. On open sites it has a low trunk and an
   open branched crown, in the forest the trunk can be up to 2/3 of the
   tree height. USES The wood is hard, strong, and tough. It can be used
   for tool handles, furniture, joinery, poles, mining timber, fence
   posts, and firewood. The bark has a high tanning content. The tree is
   planted as an ornamental, as a windbreak, and for gully stabilisation
   and it is a good source of pollen for bees. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing
   perennial. COMMON NAMES Bodalla wattle, Bodalla silver wattle, Red
   wattle. FURTHER INF Bodalla wattle can be found in a small area in
   southeastern Australia within the latitudinal range 35-38Â°S at
   elevations between sea level and 1000 m. It occurs on a wide range of
   topography including river valleys in hilly to mountainous contry,
   steep rocky hillsides, and stony ridges. It may have the potential of
   becomming a weed on some sites. (pH estimated by the compiler).
