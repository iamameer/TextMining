   Anatolia, Turkey. Elevation of up to 1200 m are suitable for the
   cultivation of most forms of chickpea but in Ethiopian and East Africa
   cultivation can be found up to 2300 m. Photoperiod 9-16 hours. Optimum
   seed setting is normally achieved when the relative humidity varies
   from 20-40% and mild winter or sprong rains during the vegetative stage
   are advantegeous. Excessive humidity, heavy rain or hailstorms,
   especially during the flowering stage may have detrimental effect on
   seed-setting. Chickpea is adapted to moderate temperatures during the
   growing period, but tolerates considerable heat during the fruiting and
   ripening period. Photosynthesis pathway C 3. In Africa average yield of
   rain-fed chickpea ranges from 350-1170 kg/ha. Experimental yields of up
   to 4 t/ha have been reported.
