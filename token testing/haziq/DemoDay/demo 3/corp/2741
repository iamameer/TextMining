   Notes
   (05.06.03) E2741
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen shrub or small tree up to 4 m in height
   and about 2.5 m wide. It is in leaf all year, in southern Europe it
   flowers in May-July, and the seeds ripen from October to January. USE:
   The fruits are edible and of good taste. The fruit is edible raw or
   cooked. It has a delicious aromatic taste, somewhat like a cross
   between a pineapple and a strawberry. Flowers are edible raw. The
   petals are sweet, crisp and delicious, they taste more like a fruit
   than many fruits. They should be harvested just after they begin to
   soften. Grown as an ornamental. In Europe it is suitable for gold,
   temperate and warm wintergartens, balconies and terraces. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Pineapple guava, Feijoo. FURTHER INF:
   Found in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Uruguay. Also found in New
   Zealand, United States and Europe. In Europe it is found along hedges,
   in woodland, by sunny edges, walls, south walls, and by west walls.
   Suitable for winter temperatures between 2-18°C. May not survive
   temperatures below -8 to -10°C. In Kew Gardens, London it has survived
   down to -15°C when fully dormant. Fruits can suffer damage from autumn
   frosts, though the flavour develops better at low temperatures. The
   plant can tolerate maritime exposure and salt winds. It tolerates some
   drought.
