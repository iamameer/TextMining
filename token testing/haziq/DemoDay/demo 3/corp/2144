   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A densely tufted, wiry, erect, glabrous grass up to
   0.5-1.5 m tall. USES The roots yield an essential oil used as a
   fixative for more volatile ingredients in soaps, cosmetics and
   perfumes. The roots are also used for basketry, mats, fans, screens,
   awnings, sachet bags, and other woven handicrafts. The grass is grown
   as a hedge plant, it is used for contour plantings, as erosion control
   on borders and roads, for soil recalmation for pollution and flood
   control and biomass production. KILLING TEMP -15°C to -20°C. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. The roots may be ready for harvest after 12-24
   months. COMMON NAMES Vetiver, Khas-khas grass, Lacate violeta,
   Khuskhus. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Andropogon murica. Vetiver is
   native of India and Sri Lanka. In India, it is normally grown at
   altitudes between sea level and 600 m, while in Bolivia, it is grown
   successfully up to 2500 m. In Africa, it can be found from sea level to
   1100 m. It requires a hot and humid climate. In Indonesia, it is for
   the production of roots, grown on loose sandy ground or young vulcanic
   ashes from which the roots can easily be pulled. Vetiver comes in two
   types, one of them (a domesticated type from South India) is suitable
   for erosion control, while the other (a wild type from North India) may
   spread and produce a weed problem for farmers. Photosynthesis pathway
   C4. The yield is 1-5 t dried roots per ha per year, and at an oil
   content of 0.7-2.5%, this produces up to 40-100 kg oil per ha. It is
   highly tolerant to Ag, Cd, Mn, Al and other heavfy metals and toxic
   materials. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
