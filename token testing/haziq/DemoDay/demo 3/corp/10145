   thick woody rootstock and many branches. Leaflets elliptic or
   lanceolate, narrowed to both ends, 5-33 mm long, 1-9 mm wide. Flowers
   cream to yellow. Pod 4-9 mm long. USE: Used in pasture in mixtures with
   perennial grasses or for improving fertility of fallow areas through
   leaf drop and nitrogen fixation. Prostrate forms are useful for soil
   erosion control. It has also been intercropped with millet in dry
   areas. It is heavily grazed by livestock in native pastures in Africa.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial or annual in areas with poor rainfall COMMON

   western and southern Asia. Found in grassland, woodland, scrub and weed
   of old cultivations. Can tolerate light shade and frequently grows
   under Acacia in the African savannas. Occurs from sea level up to about
   2000 m in the tropics. Grow well at temperatures between 25-30Â°C. It
   can tolerate short cool periods and light frosts. Found in areas with
   annual rainfall from less than 300 to more than 1500 mm. It is
   moderately tolerant to waterlogging and very drought tolerant. Best
   growth on sandy, well-drained, alkaline soils and tolerant of acid and
   clay soils. It grows well in soils from pH 4.0-8.0 and is tolerant of
   low fertility.
