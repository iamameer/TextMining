   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herbaceous, often spined, thistle-like plant
   reaching a height of 30-180 cm. It has a deep taproot and a strong stem
   with many branches, each terminating in a flower. USES Seeds are
   extracted for oil used in paints, varnishes, cooking, illumination, and
   in the manifacture of soap. A scarlet red dye, insoluble in water, can
   be obtained from the dried florets and used for dying clothes, cakes,
   bisquits, and rouge. KILLING T Seedling in the rosette leafy state is
   frost-resistant to -7° to -14°C depending on the varieties, after this
   stage frost below -2°C may destroy the plant. GROWING PERIOD Annual.
   Autumn-planted crop varies in growing period from 200-245 days, when
   planted in spring it varies from 120-160 days. COMMON NAMES Safflower,
   Carthame, Cartamo, Alazor, Saflor. FURTHER INF Safflower is probably
   native of an area bounded by the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian
   Gulf. Production is approximately restricted to the region within the
   latitudes 20°S and 40°N. It is usually grown below 900 m in elevation
   but not suited for the low hot tropics, in Ethiopia it is grown up to
   1400 m and in Kenya up to 1800 m in elevation. Emerging plants need
   cool temperatures for root growth and rosette development (mean daily
   temperature 15 to 20°C) and high temperatures during stem growth,
   flowering and yield formation periods (20 to 30°C). Humidity should be
   medium to low and safflower shows good resistance to drought and wind.
   Photosynthesis pathway C3 II. Yields of fresh petals may range from
   0.1-0.7 t/ha, giving up to 150 kg/ha of dry drug. Yields of seeds from
   1.1-1.7 t/ha. Bees or other insects are generally necessary for optimum
   fertilization and maximum yields.
