   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 15-46 m, branchless for up
   to 30 m, dbh 2-4.75 m. Bole clean, very straight with small buttresses
   and sometimes fluted. Mature trees very flat topped with a wide
   horizontal canopy of evenly distributed foliage arising from the apex
   of the straight bole. In young trees, the branches are whorled. Leaves
   6.4-12.7 x 2.5-6 cm, whorled, simple, oval. USE: The wood is used for
   fine carpentry, joinery, building, flooring and plywood manufacture and
   also for firewood and charcoal. The tree provides good shade and is
   planted with coffee, banana and cocoa. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Idigbo, Framire. FURTHER INF: Idigbo can be found at
   elevations from sea level to 700 m. The latitudinal range of natural
   occurrence is 4-11Â°N. It is sometimes found in rainforest conditions
   but is predominantly a tree of seasonal forest zones. It is an emergent
   in the upperstorey of seasonal forest but sometimes loses its
   vertical-growing leader, resulting in considerable variation in height
   of mature trees. A strong light demander and a good colonizer of
   abandoned farmlands, it can withstand short periods of inundation,
   though it is usually sensitive to waterlogging. For optimum
   development, it requires high, well-distributed rainfall. The most
   suitable soils are lateritic loams, well-drained loams, sandy loams,
   clay loams and volcanic soils. It is very vulnerable to fire. It
   requires wide spacing. Annual wood production potential is 8-17 m3/ha.
