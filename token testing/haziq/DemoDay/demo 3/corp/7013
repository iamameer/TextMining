   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Deciduous tree reaching 25-50 m in height. It develops a
   long, smooth trunk and a small rounded crown when growing in the
   forest. In the open, the trunk forks low with a few ascending and
   spreading coarse branches. The root system usually consists of a deep
   taproot and several wide-spreading lateral roots. The bark on young
   trees is dark and scaly but becomes darker with rounded intersecting
   ridges on mature trees. USE: The wood is heavy, strong. It is used
   principally for furniture, radio, television and piano cabinets; and as
   an interior finish. The veneer is used for the highest grade cabinets
   and plywood panels. The nuts are used as food by humans and are
   harvested commercially. The nuts are eaten plain or with honey and used
   to flavour cakes, candy, and ice cream. Native Americans used the nuts
   for food and extracted black dye from the roots. The tree is cultivated
   as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. The tree mature in about
   100 years and may live and produce nuts for up to 250 years. Growing
   period from April-May to September-October. COMMON NAMES: Black walnut,
   American black walnut, Eastern walnut. FURTHER INF: Black walnut is a
   native of eastern and central United States. It is found on a variety
   of sites. Good agricultural soils are generally favourable, whereas it
   grows slowly on wet bottomlands, dry ridges, and slopes. Common tree
   associates include American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry (Celtis
   laevigata), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), box elder (Acer
   negundo), and butternut (Juglans cinerea). It is classified as shade
   intolerant. In mixed forest stands, it must be dominant to survive,
   although it can survive in the relatively light shade of black locust.
