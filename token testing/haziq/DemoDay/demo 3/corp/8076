   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized evergreen tree (palm) with usually
   clustered, straight or slightly curved stems reaching up to 25 m or
   more in height, with a diameter of 10-15 cm or up to 25 cm. The stems
   have black prickles, 2,5-6.5 cm long. Leaves are up to 3.5 m long,
   pinnate, drooping. USES The hard, elastic and durable outer zone of the
   stem is used for purposes like construction, piling, rafters and
   flooring, tools and weapons and furniture. The spines on the stem are
   used for blow-darts and as heads of javelins for spearing fish. The
   cabbage can be eaten, raw or cooked. Flowers are used to flavour rice,
   fruits to make preserves and as substitute for betel. The leaves are
   used for basketry, roofing and the contain fibres. The plant can also
   be grown as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
   Nibong, Gendiwong, Erang, Libung, Nibung, Sumasula, Anau, Kenab,
   Anibong, Anibung, Ta-aon, Chaon, Laao cha on, Nhum. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: O. filamentosum, Areca tigillaria. Nibong occurs
   near the sea-shore in the major part of South-East Asia. It can be
   found behind the mangroves, on elevated spots in areas of fresh water
   swamps above the highest flood mark. It appears to be growing in the
   succession of vegetation where peat solis starts to be formed and
   accretion of land occurs. Production in well managed stands is
   estimated to be up to 60 stems/ha, which, with a diameter of 15-20 cm
   and an average length of 17 m per tree, amounts to a wood production of
   about 20m3/ha. (pH estimated by the compiler).
