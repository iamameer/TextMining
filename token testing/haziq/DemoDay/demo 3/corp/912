   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A creeping, stoloniferous, tufted grass with slender,
   blue-tinged culms up to 45 cm tall with fine pointed, glabrous leaves,
   4ˆ20 cm long, 2ˆ6 mm wide. It spread by both seed and runners. Stolons
   can grow to 1.5ˆ2 metres. USES: It is very palatable, even to maturity.
   Used for hay and pasture and withstands heavy grazing. Can also be used
   for ground cover and erosion control. GROWING PERIOD Summer-growing
   perennial. COMMON NAMES Nadi blue grass, Nawai grass, Jiribilla,
   Antigua hay grass. FURTHER INF: It is native of South-East Asia. It can
   be found at elevations from 600-1000 m and is common on swampy places,
   open humid woodland and black cotton soils. It is quite drought
   tolerant, but makes little growth in dry weather and withstands
   waterlogging well. Well adapted to 1500ˆ2500 mm rainfall with a
   moderate dry season of 5ˆ6 months. Preferably full sunlight but will
   grow under moderate shade. Generally found on heavier (black) clays of
   moderate fertility. Such soils are generally slightly acid to alkaline,
   with no Al problems. Drainage can be poor under high rainfall. Said to
   be found on sandy soils in southern India. Poor salt tolerance. Dry
   matter yields may be about 11-23 t/ha.
