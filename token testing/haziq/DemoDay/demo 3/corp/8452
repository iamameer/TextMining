   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an erect, annual herb that grows 0.3 to 2 m tall.
   The villose stems are purple or green with four parallel grooves.
   Opposite leaves are membranous or herbaceous, broadly ovate or
   orbicular, 7-13 cm long and 4.5-10 cm wide, with mucronate tips, a
   rounded or broad cuneate bases, and dentate margins. The pilose surface
   of the leaves may be green or purple on both sides, or purple on the
   underside only. Each leaf has seven to eight pairs of lateral veins,
   which are closer together near the base. The veins on the upper surface
   are slightly raised, significantly so on the underside. The petiole is
   flat and villose. Composed of a pair of flowers, the villose corymb
   inflorescence may grow terminally or from the leaf axil. The
   ten-veined, campanulate calyx is villous basally outside and yellow
   glandular dotted on the surface, and pilose near the inside base,
   arranged in a ring. The calyx is initially about 3 mm long, but expands
   to 1.1 cm, spreading or drooping and swollen at the base when fruited.
   The labiate calyx has a broad upper sepal that is three-lobed and
   slightly longer than the lower sepal, which has two lanceolate lobes.
   The corolla is campanulate, white to magenta, 3-4 mm long, glabrous,
   and slightly pilose outside but less so inside. The limb of the corolla
   is also labiate, and composed of a slightly lobed upper petal and
   three-lobed lower petal. The sub-globose fruits are reticulate nutlets,
   grayish brown, about 1.5 mm in diameter. In China, flowers and fruits
   appear in August and linger until November to December. USES: It is
   widely cultivated as a source of medicine and spices. Perilla oil, a
   drying oil, which is contained in the seed, is edible (a cooking oil)
   and also used as a preservative and energy source. It is used in making
   paints, varnishes, water proofing etc. The seeds of perilla contain 31
   to 51% of this drying oil, which is similar to tung or linseed oil. The
   plant yields 0.3-1.3% essential oil, which contains 20% citral. It is
   also used in dental products. One of the aldehyde isomers found in
   Perilla is 2,000 times as sweet as sugar. HABITAT: It is found wild in
   pastures and fields, dry woods, along roadsides, about home-sites, and
   in waste places. ENVIRONMENT: It needs warm weather and can grow in
   full sun as well as light (not dark) shade. However, the seed needs
   light to sprout. It thrives in well drained as well as wet soils. It
   grows well on fertile sites. It is hardy to zone 8 and is frost tender.
   It prefers light (sandy) and medium (loamy) acid, neutral and basic
   (alkaline) soils. COMMON NAMES: It is widely known as the beefsteak
   plant. In North America, it is increasingly commonly called by its
   Japanese name, shiso in addition to being generally referred to as
   perilla. FURTHER INF.: The economic return from production of perilla
   as an oilseed in the United States is unprofitable in comparison with
   linseed. It has been determined that although perilla is well adapted
   to the climate of the south eastern United States, it will be
   unprofitable unless seed shattering can be controlled.
