   containing many small seeds. USES It is grown for its immature fruits

   confectionery. It is used as a spice and it is also used in perfumes
   and soaps and have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   Short cuttings, 30 cm in length, will take 3-5 years to flower and
   fruit, longer cuttings, 90-100 cm can fruit after 1-2 years. The plant
   has an economical life of about 10-15 years. Fruits mature in 180-270
   days. COMMON NAMES Vanilla, Vanille, Bannitta, Vainilla, Panili,
   Anggrek, Waanilaa. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: V. fragrans. Vanilla
   is native of southeastern Mexico and Central America. In the wild state
   vanilla usually grows climbing on trees in warm, wet tropical low land
   forests from sea-level to 600 m in elevation. It thrives in hot moist
   insular climates with frequent, but not excessive rain and it require
   two drier months to check vegetative growth and bring the vines into
   flower. It is usually found within the latitudinal range 20°N-20°S. Too
   heavy rain during the ripening of the fruits can have a harmfull
   effect. The fruits are harvested before they are fully ripe, after
   which the are fermented and cured. Yields are very variable. A good
   vanillery may yield about 2.5-4 t/ha per year of fresh fruit, which
   gives 500-800 kg/ha of cured beans. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species.
