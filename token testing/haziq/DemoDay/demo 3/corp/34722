   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a grass-like evergreen, clump-forming, perennial,
   herbaceous plant growing quickly to 25-35 cm in height and 60-90 cm in
   width. Planted in and hanging from a basket it can become 60-90 cm
   long. Wiry stalks up to 1.5 m long appear on healthy plants with many
   small white flowers. After blooming and fruiting, little tufts of
   leaves - plantlets - develop on the stalks. These little "spiders" take
   root wherever they touch the ground. USE: It is one of the most common
   houseplants. It is easily grown and is especially popular for the ease
   and speed with which it forms new plants. It makes excellent hanging
   baskets. In frost free climates, spider plant is used as a groundcover,
   in borders and as edging around beds, walkways and paths. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Spider plant. FURTHER INF: Low
   humidity and excessively dry soil may also cause brown leaf tips. Leaf
   tip burn is caused by too much fertilizer or water that is high in
   soluble salts. Plants should dry out briefly between waterings. A
   general-purpose potting soil is suitable for spider plants. Outdoors
   the plant will however grow in most well drained and somewhat fertile
   soils. It is native of coastal areas of South Africa.
