   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized evergreen tree reaching a
   height of 7-10 m and a trunk diameter of 10-25 cm. It require wide
   spacing. Trunk and branches are crooked. USES Cashew nuts are roasted
   for human consumption. The nut contain an oil similar to almond oil and
   is commonly used in chocolate making. The nut shell yields a poisonous
   oil with medicinal properties. The fruit is eaten fresh or used in
   jams, candies, and chutneys. Unripe fruits are used in curried
   vegetables and pickles. Fruit juice is used for wines, vinegar, and
   juice blends. The tree can be used for shade, hedges, reforestation,
   sand dune stabilization, and as an ornamental. The wood is used for
   crates, yokes, boats, firewood, and charcoal. Young leaves and flowers
   can be eaten in salads. The flowers are a source of honey. Gum of the
   bark is reported to be a good insecticide. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial. Growing
   2-3 years to first bearing. It usually live 15-20 or 25 years, but up
   to 45 years. Flowering takes 30-60 days from the time of flower
   initiation, fruit maturation a further 70-130 days, and vegetative
   growth (wet season), takes place for up to about 260 days, after which
   the tree enters a period of quiescence. COMMON NAMES Cashew, Cashew

   tropical America probably northeastern Brazil. The tree occur naturally
   within the latitudinal range of 30°N-25°S. In the tropics the tree can
   be found at altitudes between sea level and 1200 m where it often is
   grown on hillsides too dry and too stony for other crops.
   Photosynthesis pathway C3. Humidity should be high during the period of
   vegetative growth (65-80%) and lower during flowering. In general the
   minimum relative humidity should be about 20-25% and the maximum
   35-75%. Rainfall during the flowering and harvesting periods may reduce
   yields. At rainfall below 500 mm the tree is only valuable for timber
   and firewood. It has been stated that both pigeon pea and castor bean
   are harmful if grown before cashew on the same land. Yields range from
   2 kg/tree for young trees to 45 kg/tree for 15 year old trees. The tree
   is termite resistant and drought hardy.
