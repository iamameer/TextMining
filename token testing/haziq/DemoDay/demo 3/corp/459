   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized evergreen tree reaching a
   height of 8-30 m and a trunk diameter of 30-80 cm or even up to 200 cm.
   It usually have a straight stem, rough, scaly bark, branches near the
   base and have a dense, on open sites spreading and irregular crown. The
   fruit is barrel- or pear-shaped, golden-yellow, 30-100 x 25-50 cm, with
   short pyramidal warts. USES The fruit is edible, the young fruit is
   cooked as a vegetable, pickled or canned, while the mature fruit is
   eaten fresh or made into chutney, jam, jelly and paste, or preserved as
   candies. The fruit pulp is also used to flavour ice-cream and
   beverages. The seeds are edible when boiled, roasted or dried and
   salted. The tree can be used as shade tree for coffee and for
   reforstation. The wood is durable and used for tool handles, guitars,
   ukuleles, timber and fuel. Leaves can be used as fodder. The bark
   contain tannin. Many parts of the tree have medicinal properties.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. KILLING TEMP Mature trees
   have been known to withstand -3°C, but young trees are killed by frost
   and old trees usually damaged. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Some cultivars
   begins fruiting after 3 years but most cultivars fruit after 8 years.
   Ripe fruit develop 6 to 8 months after pollination, while unripe fruits
   used as vegetables can be harvested after 3 to 4 months. The fruiting

   integra, A. philippensis, A. brasiliensis, A. maxima. Jackfruit is
   indigenous to India and Malaysia, it is best grown under humid tropical
   lowland conditions, but will tolerate altitudes up to 1300 m or even
   1600 m in elevation. It fruits up to latitudes 30°N and S in frost-free
   areas and bears good crops between 25°N and S. It has poor drought and
   flooding tolerance. Yields in experimental stations of 20-500
   fruits/tree/annum have been reported with an average of 100-200 fruits.
   The fruits may weigh 10-50 kg each with an average between 20-30 kg.
   However, average yields in Malaysia and the Philippines are about
   70-100 kg of fruit per tree each year.
