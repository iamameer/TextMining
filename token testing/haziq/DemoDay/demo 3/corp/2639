   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: The tree occupies a range of habitats and is consequently
   very variable. It ranges from a less than 2 meter tall shrub up to a
   12-22 meter tall erect tree. It often has an upright profile with
   curved ascending branches, rich green foliage and striking colourful
   appearance when flowering. USE: It fixes nitrogen, provides shade,
   stabilizes sand dunes and degraded and disturbed areas. Its leaves,
   flowers and pods provide excellent fodder, the gum has many uses and it
   is a good honey tree, producing quantities of pollen and nectar three
   or four times a year during flowering. The wood is an excellent fuel,
   the timber is used for general purposes and the bark can be used for
   tanning and cordage. Bark and leaf infusions are astringent and widely
   used for diarrhoea and dysentery and an antidote to Œtulp‚ (Morea)
   poisoning in cattle. An infusion of the roots is used for general body
   pains and for dizziness, convulsions, gonorrhoea and as an aphrodisiac
   and are mixed in food for young infants with colic. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Sweet thorn, Mimosa thorn, Cape thorn tree.
   FURTHER INF: It occupies a diverse range of habitats including dry
   thornveld, river valley scrub, bushveld, woodland, grassland, banks of
   dry watercourses, riverbanks, coastal dunes and coastal scrub. It grows
   on most soil types, but is often found on soils with a relatively high
   fertility such as clay and loam. Often associated with alluvial soils
   along the banks of rivers and streams. It is tolerant to cold, wind,
   fire and salt spray. It is an aggressive pioneer, readily invading
   degraded or overgrazed areas. Very cold tolerant and resistant to frost
   ˆ10°C which may cause defoliation but does not kill the trees. Young
   plants are however frost sensitive. It is the most widespread Acacia in
   southern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Angola, Zambia, Malawi
   and Mozambique.
