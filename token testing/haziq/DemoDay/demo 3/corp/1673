   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A evergreen tree (palm) reaching 15-40 m in height
   with a terminal crown of 100-120, 4-7 m long pinnate leaves. USES The
   fruits are usually eaten fresh or dried. Date pulp is a good source of
   calcium, phosphorous, and carbohydrates. Palm trunks can be tapped for
   a sap taht is made into palm wine. Palm leaves have been used as thatch
   and fiber. KILLING T Leaves may tolerate -4 to -6°C and the tree -15°C.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Begin fruiting within 2-4 years and normally
   reach full production at 5-8 years, (Rice; 8-10 years) but productivity
   may increase up to 9-15 years. Yields decline after 40-50 years, but
   the tree will continue to produce up to about 75 years. COMMON NAMES
   Date, Palmier dattier, Datilera, Dattelpalme, Khajur, Khaji, Thinbaw
   thinbaung, Tamareira, Palmera, Datilera. FURTHER INF The tree
   transpires large quantities of moisture and the amount of available
   rainfall is often little, or entire absent in the production areas. The
   water requirement of the palm must be provided for by ground water (the
   roots of the tree can reach 2-6 m deep) or by irrigation. Irrigation is
   needed about every 14 days in the summer and 20-30 days in the winter.
   The water requirement of the palms is about 10000-50000 m3/ha per year,
   or 1.5 m3 per palm per week as an average over the year. Relative
   humidity should be between 40 and 50% during ripening time. Rain during
   flowering can hinder the pollination and rain during the fruit
   development can lead to bursting and dacay of the fruit. An average
   well-managed palm can produce about 60-70 kg of fresh dates per year.
   The palm can be grown at elevations between sea level and 1500 m.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
