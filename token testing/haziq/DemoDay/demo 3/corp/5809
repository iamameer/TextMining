   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An evergreen or deciduous tree reaching up to 35 m in
   height and 2 m in diameter. The tree shifts from evergreen to deciduous
   along a rainfall gradient from the humid lowlands to the subhumid
   mountains. The leafless period is quite short and is possibly caused by
   flowering rather than drought. A visible reduction of foliage during
   flowering also occurs under humid conditions. The crown is moderately
   spreading and the bole tends to be branchless below 10-20 m. Bark is
   greyish brown or grey, with thorn-like protuberances. Leaves are
   alternate, trifoliolate. Flowers caducous, orange or reddish, produced
   in racemes. USE: Leaves as used as fodder, wood as fuel. It is planted
   as a shade tree in cacao and coffee plantations, it conserves soil and
   contributes to high and sustainable yields. For alley cropping, it
   should be planted in dense hedgerows (1-2 m between trees), with wide
   alleys (6-8 m) between tree rows. High and sustainable bean yield in
   the alley-cropping system has been observed. In Costa Rica, E.
   poeppigiana alley cropping has sustained 2 maize crops per year over 8
   years without fertilization. It nodulates abundantly with
   nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Bradyrhizobium and leaves are
   used as green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: coral
   tree. FURTHER INF: It is native to humid and subhumid tropical
   lowlands, such as the riverine and upland forests of the Amazon and
   Orinoco Basins, but cultivated and naturalized trees are now found at
   elevations up to 2000 m. Tolerates low soil fertility and relatively
   high acidity (down to pH 4.3). However, tolerance varies by genotype.
