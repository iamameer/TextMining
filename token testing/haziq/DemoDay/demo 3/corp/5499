   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A slow growing medium sized to tall tree reaching a
   height of 25-40 m, bole branchless for up to 20 m, with a girth of
   2.5-3.5 m and no buttresses. USES The timber is used for medium to
   heavy constructions but it is not very durable in contact with the
   ground. When treated with a preservative the timber can also be used
   outdoors. Because of its resinous nature it is less suitable for
   flooring and woodwork exposed to the sun, or to be painted. It is used
   for veneer, plywwod, paper pulp and charcoal. An oleo-resin can be
   extracted and used as a coat for waterproofing paper, as a varnish for
   boats, walls and furniture. The oleo-resin and also the bark of the
   tree have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
   Dulia garjan, Keruing bukit, Kanyin in, Kanyin po, Kanyin-ywet-the,
   Chhe: ti:el bangku:ey, Chhe: ti:el ni:eng daeng, Nha:ng de:ng,
   Yang-pai, Yang-khao, Yang-kabueang. FURTHER INF Dulia garjan occurs in
   Bangladesh, Myanmar and on the Andaman Islands. It is found on flat
   land as well as on undulating country, slopes and hill tops at
   elevations up to 1200 m. The tree requires shade in youth. Wood
   production may be 20-40 m3/ha/year.
