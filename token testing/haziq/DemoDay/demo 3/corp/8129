   with stems up to 70 cm long forming a dense canopy. Leaves pinnate,
   with 9-18 pairs of greenish-blue leaflets up to 1 cm long.
   Inflorescence an umbel of 2-5 pink to white flowers. USE: Used for
   rotational grazing or silage with high nutritive value. GROWING PERIOD:
   Annual. Life cycle adapted to escape summer drought. Seeds germinate in
   autumn following summer dormancy and the onset of autumn rainfall.
   COMMON NAMES: Pink serradella. FURTHER INF: Grown as summer annual in
   south-west Europe. Introduced to south-west Australia where grown as
   cool-season annual. Adapted to regions with a Mediterranean-type
   climate and to warm, temperate areas. Requires annual rainfall of 500
   mm upwards. Late-flowering types require more rainfall during autumn to
   spring growth period than early-flowering types in order to encourage
   seed production. Best adapted to lighter, well drained and fertile
   soils but is tolerant of infertile, acid and heavy soils. DM yields of
   about 4 t/ha have been reported.
