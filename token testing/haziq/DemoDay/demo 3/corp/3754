   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 20-40 m in height and a
   trunk diameter of more than 1 m in natural stands. Its most
   distinguishing features are its spiny main stem, fluted base, a rather
   wide spreading crown of heavy branches and a somewhat irregular bole
   inclined to be buttressed. The degree of spininess is variable, as some
   trees are completely spineless. USE: The heartwood is reddish in colour
   and the sapwood cream or white. The wood is known for its durability
   and workability, it is used for furniture, doors, window and ceiling
   frames, roof construction, interior panelling, particleboard, plywood
   and veneer. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Pochote, Cedro
   espino, Saquisaqui, Ceiba tolua, Ceiba colorada. FURTHER INF:
   Scientific synonyms: B. fendleri, B. sepium. It can be found in dry to
   very dry, or wet tropical forests at elevations between sea level and
   900 m. It is naturally distributed in tropical America from 2°-13°30'N.
   The tree is shade tolerant in youth.
