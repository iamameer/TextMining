   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A bushy, evergreen tree with a spreading habit
   reaching 5-20 m in height. The fruit is bright red when ripe and the
   skin is covered with soft, fleshy spines, up to 6 x 3.5 cm. Leaves
   ovate to obovate, 2-28 x 2-10.5 cm. USES In good cultivars the edible
   aril is plump, sweet and juicy. The sweet tasting fruits are eaten
   fresh, the more sour ones are eaten stewed. It can also be canned or
   used as jam, but loses a lot of its flavour. The seed kernels can be
   used for the production of a solid fat, which is edible and also used
   for soap and candles. Most parts of the tree have medicinal properties
   and young shoots, fruit walls and leaves are used as dye. The wood can
   be used for general construction and the tree can be grown as an
   ornamental. KILLING T Young trees up to 3-4 years will not tolerate
   frost, while older trees may survive -1 to -2°C. Temperatures about
   5-6°C will cause defoliation. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Begins to bear
   5-7 years after sowing or 3-5 years after planting. Yields increase up
   to 8-10 years, the economic life is about 15-20 years and may be up to
   30 years, and the tree may last up to 60 years. COMMON NAMES Rambutan,
   Hairy litchee, Ramboutan, Litchi chevelu, Rambut, Ramustan, Ngo phruan,
   Usan, Ser mon, Chle sao mao, Ngoh, Phruan, Chom chom, Vai thieu.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: N. glabrum. N. chryseum, N.
   sufferrugineum. Rambutan is probably indigenous to Malaysia and
   Indonesia. It require hot and humid conditions and thrives in the humid
   tropical lowlands at elevations between sea level and 600 m, within
   about 12° from the equator. It can, however, tolerate climates with 2-3
   dry months. It occurs in both primary and secondary forests. It is best
   grown in the shade when young and the tree needs wind protection. Trees
   usually fruit twice a year giving 1000-1500 fruits per tree per year at
   5-7 years and 5000-6000 fruits per tree for older trees. Very good
   trees may produce up to 170 kg per tree. Yields may be from 2-20 t/ha.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
