   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A low, spreading, herbaceous legume. The stems may reach a
   length of up to 1 m. It has reddish yellow or pale purple flowers.
   USES: It is cultivated for pasture, hay, and forage. It is also used
   for soil improvement and conservation and provides effective erosion
   control on newly established terraces. It is used as cover crop on
   rubber plantations. GROWING PERIOD: Summer annual or short-lived
   perennial. COMMON NAMES: Alyce clover. FURTHER INF It is native of East
   Africa and South-East Asia. It is grown from sea level to 1400 m
   altitude in many tropical areas. It is native of areas with between
   900-2000 mm annual rainfall and can stand dry seasons of up to 6 months
   but may behave as an annual in more dry regions. The leaves are killed
   by light to moderate frosts and the plants are killed by heavy frosts
   but generally regenerates strongly from seed in the following
   spring/summer. It grows on a wide range of soil types from coralline
   sands to moderately acid clays. It has moderate fertility requirements
   and will respond to P and K fertilisers when growing on infertile
   soils. Its susceptibility to nematodes can limit productive growth to
   heavier soils, including black clays. Low salinity tolerance. It does
   not like waterlogged conditions but can tolerate short-term flooding.
   It is a common weed of lawns throughout the Asian region. It is very
   susceptible to nematodes. Hay yields average from 3.7-6.5 t/ha.
