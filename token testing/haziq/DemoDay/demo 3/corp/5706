   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is one of the largest trees in the dry forest
   formation, reaching up to 40 m in height and 3 m in diameter, with a
   huge, spreading crown. Older trees develop small buttresses and produce
   large roots that run along the surface of the ground for 2-3 m.
   Sidewalks, roads, or foundations may be cracked or raised by trees
   growing close by. The seed pods on this tree are shaped like
   "Elephant's Ears." USE: Immature pods are cooked as a vegetable, or the
   seeds are toasted and ground. Leaves and especially pods are used as
   fodder. The wood is us as timber and for paper production. Tannin from
   the pods and bark is used in soap making. Bark extracts are used
   medicinally against colds and bronchitis. It is an ideal shade tree for
   livestock in pasturelands and perennial crops such as coffee. A popular
   tree for roadsides and urban planting. It is a nitrogen-fixing species.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: ear pod tree, elephant ear,
   enterolobium. FURTHER INF: Colonizing a wide range of habitats, it is a
   climax species in subtropical, dry forest zones, restricted to
   disturbed areas in wetter forest types. It is a dominant species in all
   the tree associations in which it is found. Dry seasons of 1-6 months
   are usual in most of its habitats. It tolerates alkaline, calcareous
   and even acidic soils. Medium-textured soils are probably best, but
   eroded Ultasols, deep moist clays, shallow sandy clays and porous
   limestone all allow good development.
