   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A variable grass, with a root system down to 4.5 m deep.
   Culms 2-3 (-4 m) tall, and 3-5 cm thick at base. Leaf-blade to 1.5 m
   long and 9-35 mm wide. Inflorescence 10-20 (-30) cm long. USE: Used for
   forage (well-managed pasture, green-chop, cut and carry, hay or
   silage), soil conservation and as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Bullgrass. FURTHER INF: Native of America
   between 42째N-24째S and from near sea level to 2100 m. Found in moist
   undisturbed grasslands, prairies, coastal plains, semi-arid regions,
   rocky outcrops, openings in forests and on stream, river and marshes
   edges. Found in areas with annual rainfall from 600-1500 mm.
   Ppreferring moist, occasionally waterlogged soils, but intolerant of
   more than 3 weeks of flooding. Average annual temperatures from between
   10-24째C. Tops are burnt by heavy frost, recommencing growth in early
   spring. Plants survive temperatures as low as -30째C, but require at
   least 140 frost free days/year for longer-term persistence. Prefers
   deep, moist, moderately well drained, fertile soils, with textures
   ranging from sand to clay and pH from 5.5-7.5. It is also adapted to
   poorly drained soils, but, unlike many species from such situations,
   has low salt tolerance. DM yields up to 20-30 t/ha/year have been
   reported.
