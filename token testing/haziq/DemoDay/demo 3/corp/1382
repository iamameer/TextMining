   Notes
   DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized, upright, evergreen tree reaching
   10-18 m in height and a spread of up to 15 m, with ovate leaves, 10-30
   cm x 2-4 cm, almost free of spines. Fruit a globose follicle, 2.5-4 cm
   in diameter, seed (nut) mostly one, globular, with a smooth, hard,
   thick (2-5 mm) testa enclosing the edible kernel. USES The edible seed
   eaten as a 'nut' is a source of protein, carbohydrates, calcium,
   thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, phosphorous, iron, fat and vitamin B1. It
   is eaten raw or roasted and salted. The decomposed husk is often used
   in potting soils. It is mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
   KILLING T Best adapted to frost-free climate. Affected by frosts in the
   0 to -2°C range but mature trees may be tolerant of short periods down
   to -6°C. Macadamia does not have a true dormant period. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Grafted trees begins to bear after the 3rd or 4th year,
   reaches a maximum about the 18th year and is still profitable for 40-60
   years or more. May survive up to 100 years. Require 210-230 days from
   flowering to fruit maturity. COMMON NAMES Macadamia. FURTHER INF It is
   native to the fringes of subtropical coastal rainforests of
   southeastern Queensland, Australia and is home in the same type of
   climate as Coffea arabica. It can be grown from sea level in
   subtropical areas and at 1000-1600 m in elevation in tropical areas
   with a prominently seasonal climate. The tree tolerates low relative
   humidity, and there is no difference in flowering and fruit set between
   2 and 40% relative humidity. Strong winds are harmfull due to the
   brittleness ot the wood. Cool nights induce flowering. Fully-grown
   trees supply about 45-50 kg unshelled nuts per year and yields of 3-10
   t/ha are considered normal. Planting on steep slopes may cause erosion
   problems, and shelter from strong winds are desirable.
