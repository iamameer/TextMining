   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree usually reaching 6-15 m in height
   but may become up to 20 m tall. Young trunks are banded and blotched in
   grey and white and are fairly smooth, in old trees the bark is dark
   brown, light grey or reddish, thick. Leaves are leathery, smooth,
   opposite, elliptic, oval or almost circular, up to 2.5-13 x 1.9-8 cm.
   Flowers are creamy white to pinkish and sweetly scented. USE: The
   bitter-tasting fresh fruit is eaten raw or used to make an alcoholic
   drink. A good quality jelly can be cooked from the ripe fruit. Leaves
   can be used as fodder and flowers produce an abundance of nectar. Wood
   is used as timber and as firewood and charcoal. The bark can be
   extracted for dye and is used as fish poison. Roots and bark are boiled
   and the decoction is used as a remedy for indigestion and giddiness; an
   extract of the leaves is used to as a purgative or to treat diarrhoea.
   The tree is used for erosion control in places subject to flooding, and
   as a shade, ornamental and living fence tree. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: water tree, water-berry tree, waterbessie,
   waterwood. FURTHER INF: It is common near fresh water or along fresh
   watercourses. It occurs in lowlands as well as medium- to high-latitude
   forests, along stream banks and in riverine thickets. The tree is
   believed to indicate underground water and is strongly fire resistant.
   It is an indicator of areas suitable for sugarcane farming. The tree is
   resistant to cold but not frost, and it is a protected species in South
   Africa.
