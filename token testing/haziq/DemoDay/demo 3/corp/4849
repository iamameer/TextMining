   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herbaceous plant with a straight, slender stem, 3-4
   m in height under cultivation. USES It is grown as a fiber crop. The
   fibers are used for coarse woven fabrics, sacking, or fibers. It is
   also used in twines and carpet yarns. The soft fibers are weaker than
   hemp or flax. GROWING PERIOD Annual, may be harvested after 80-150
   days, depending on varirty. COMMON NAMES White jute, Yute, Jute.
   FURTHER INF White jute is native to a region including India, Myanmar
   and sourthern China. It can be found in tropical lowland and perhaps
   also highland. It require a humid climate with a relative humidity
   between 60 and 90% in the growing period, but diurnal fluctuations of
   up to 50% are not a disadvantage. Young plants are sensitive to
   waterlogging, but more mature plants will tolerate flooding. White jute
   is often grown on areas that are inundated every year and enriched by
   deposits. It is a short-day plant but longer days prolong the
   vegetative phase and it is therefore normally sown when the day-length
   exceeds 12.5 hours. White jute is more commonly grown than the closely
   related, tussa jute (C. olitorius). Yields may be about 34 t/ha of
   green plants giving 2 t/ha of dry retted fiber.
