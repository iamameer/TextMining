   Jamaica cherry is native of the region from southern Mexico to Bolivia
   and of the Caribbean Islands. In its native range the tree occurs
   scattered in dry to moist thickets and secondary forests along slopes
   and valleys. It thrives at elevations up to 1000 m. It is a typical
   pioneer species and may become a weed. It can establish itself in
   trodden yards and along shop fronts where no other tree takes root and
   it can withstand the air pollution in city streets. The wide-spread
   branches tend to break in high winds.
