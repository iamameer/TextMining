   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a evergreen shrub or tree. Flowers white and pinkish
   arranged in panicles, very fragrant. USE: Its great value as a tonic
   and febrifuge depends on an alkaloid, Quinine. It yields large amount
   of this alkaloid, often 70-80% of the total alkaloids contained in the
   bark. It has febrifuge, tonic and astringent properties, valuable for
   influenza, neuralgia and debility. Large and too constant doses must be
   avoided, as they produce headache, giddiness and deafness. The liquid
   extract is useful as a cure for drunkenness. The powdered bark is often
   used in tooth-powders, owing to its astringency, but not much used
   internally (except as a bitter wine); it creates a sensation of warmth,
   but sometimes causes gastric intestinal irritation. Cinchona in
   decoction is a useful gargle and a good throat astringent. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial, start flowering after 3-4 years, and are uprooted
   and harvested after 8-12 years. COMMON NAMES: Quinine (calisaya),
   Cinchone, Cincona. FURTHER INF: Tolerant to below 7Â°C. Quinine occur
   wild in the Andean rainforests in Peru and Bolivia. It can be grown in
   the tropics at altitude from 400-3000 m. It grows very poorly or not at
   all on soils that have been exposed to fire. Grows best in areas with a
   high relative humidity. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
