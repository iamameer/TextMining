   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A grass with long, deep and vigorous rhizomes. Culms
   erect, generally 25-60 cm tall, with basal leaves. Leaves erect,
   narrow, grey-green, 10-30 cm long and 2-9 mm wide. Inflorescence
   grey-green, 2-4 cm long. USE: Used for permanent pasture and may have
   application for hay and silage. Ground cover (soil conservation) under
   trees, stabilisation of waterways, traffic areas. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Brunswick grass. FURTHER INF: Native to
   Argentina (north), Brazil (south), Paraguay and Uruguay from about
   21-25ºS in Paraguay to 35ºS in Uruguay and Argentina, and from 65ºW in
   Argentina to 50ºW in Brazil, at altitudes between sea level and 500 m.
   Found in areas with 700-1500 mm of annual rainfall and average annual
   temperatures between 16-23°C. It has good cool season growth. While
   preferring sandy soils, it has also proven adapted to light to medium
   clays, and even hard-setting sandy clay loams, provided internal
   drainage is fair to good and moisture is adequate. Although it is often
   found on infertile soils, it responds to improved fertility. It prefers
   acid to slightly alkaline soils with a pH up to 8. It is drought
   tolerant, survives short periods of flooding, but does not tolerate
   permanent waterlogging. DM yields ranged from 9-28 t/ha/year.
