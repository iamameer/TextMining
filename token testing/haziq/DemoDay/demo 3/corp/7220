   height. It has succulent roots and short and decumbent stems. The
   hypocotyls, which are the edible part of the plant, vary between 2-5 cm
   in size and may have a variety of colours. USES The hypocotyl can be
   roasted, dried and boiled or used for juices, coctails, porridges and
   jams. It is also prepared in tabloid form and eaten because of its
   nutritionel value and because it is believed to stimulate sexual
   appetite and increase fertility. KILLING T -20°C. Frosts down to -10°C
   are common throughout the growing season. GROWING PERIOD Matlike
   perennial. The roots are harvested 180-210 days after planting.

   mature. Production of seed takes an additional 150-180 days. COMMON
