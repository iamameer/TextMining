   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 4-20 m in height. It has
   an open crown and slightly rounded buttresses. USE: The fermented seeds
   are used as a food condiment and leaves shoots and pods are used as
   fodder. The wood is used as charcoal and firewood and as timber for
   pestles, mortars, mallets, cudgels, furniture, joinery, sleepers in the
   construction of railway lines, boat building and axe handles. Bark and
   roots contain tannin and pounded dry fruits are suitable as a fish
   poison. The leaves are used in the treatment of headache and toothache
   as well as various other head ailments. Leaves and bark are combined to
   treat rheumatism. Remedies for skin diseases, caries, fevers and
   eyewashes are obtained from the bark. The roots are a diuretic and are
   used to treat gonorrhoea, tooth and stomach-ache, dysentery and
   bronchitis. The tree is suitable for erosion control, shade and as an
   avenue tree. It can fix atmospheric nitrogen and the fallen leaves act
   as a green manure. It has great potential for parkland agroforestry
   systems and for improved agroforestry technologies in the Sahel, where
   it grows well in valleys and rocky soils. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: abu suruj. FURTHER INF: It is the only tropical African
   Prosopis species, occurring from Senegal to Ethiopia in the zone
   between the Sahel and savannah forests. Due to extensive
   overexploitation, it has disappeared from extensive parts of the
   southern Sahel and the adjacent Sudan savannahs. Frequently on fallow
   land, on sandy clayey soils over laterite. It fairly tolerates most
   soil types.
