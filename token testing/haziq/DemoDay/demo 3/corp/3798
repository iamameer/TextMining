   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A bunch grass with narrow, primarily basal leaves and
   erect culms up to 20-60 cm tall. Leaf blades are 5-25 cm long, 3-5 mm
   wide, tapering at the ends. Roots of blue grama are fibrous, but they
   are often sod forming from short, scaly rhizomes. Most roots occur in
   the upper 35-75 cm of the soil, with a few coarser roots extending to
   depths of 1.5-1.8m. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. USE: Grown for forage.
   Magnesium and calcium levels decrease throughout the growing season. By
   September, crude protein content declined about 46%, and by the end of
   October it had declined 66%. COMMON NAMES: Blue grama. FURTHER INF: It
   occurs in the short grass region in the United States from Canada to
   Texas through Mexico into Central and South America. It is common in
   mixed grass prairie, and is occasionally found on drier sites and
   parkland regions. It grows well on sandy loam, sandy, or gravelly
   soils. It does not grow in wet, poorly drained soils. It does not
   tolerate shade, flooding, a high water table or acid soils.
   Photosynthetic pathway is C4.
