   broadly ovate leaves and yellow flowers. It is usually found in water
   0.3-3 m deep but can grow at a depth of up to 4 m. USE: The rhizome,
   leafstalks, flowers and seed are edible and the leaves and rhizome have
   medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Yellow

   light shade. It is typically found on muck, clay, or muck over clay but
   can also be found on muck over loam and sand.
