   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized tree reaching up to 20 in height, with
   a straight trunk to more than 1/2 of the tree height, smooth, and grey
   bark. The fruit is a legume twisted in a wide spiral, 20-25 x 3-4 cm.
   USES Young seeds can be eaten raw. Mature seeds are used to flavour
   food, and they can be eaten boiled, steeped for a couple of hours in
   salt water and then fried in oil, processed into chips, or germinated.
   Young wine-red shoots are eaten as a raw vegetable. The pods are a
   source of purple dye for silk and used for shampoo. The bark is a
   source of matting black dye. The ashes of burnt leaves are used against
   itching and on cuts. The timber is soft and only suitable for cabinet
   work, interior joinery or as a firewood. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. May
   start to fruit 5-6 years after sowing and the time from anthesis to
   mature fruit is about 40-50 days. COMMON NAMES Jengkol, Jering,
   Jingkol, Jringkol, Jiring, Tangyin, Tanyeng-pen, Niang, Niang-nok,
   Chaniang. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Pithecellobium lobatum, P.

   in primary and secondary evergreen rain forest on flat land and low
   undulating hills, at elevations between sea level and 1000 m or up to
   1600 m. A mature tree produces from 1000-4000 seeds per year. (pH
   estimated by the compiler).
