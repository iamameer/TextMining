   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A variable grass with culms up to 120 cm or more,
   sometimes rooting and branched from the lower nodes, sometimes
   stoloniferous or with a creeping rhizome. USES Very palatable, even
   when dry. Used for pasture it stands quite heavy grazing. Can be used
   as hay and is also useful for erosion control. KILLING T Tolerates
   light frosts. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing summer perennial grass.
   Plants are often short-lived (3-4 years) but new plants are formed from
   seedling recuitment. COMMON NAMES Sabi grass, Gonya grass, Common
   urochloa, Ya sabee. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: U. rhodesiensis, U.
   pullulans, Echinochloa notabile, Panicum mosambicense. Sabi grass
   originated in the drier, frost-free regions of southern and eastern
   Africa. It can be found at elevations from 700 to 1400 m and is common
   in grassland, usually in sheltered places, or in disturbed areas.
   Flower initiation occurs over a range of daylengths but it is earlier
   at 12 hours than at 9 or 15 hours. It has been collected as far south
   as 25Â°S at 1000 m in elevation in Africa. It is drought tolerant,
   revovers well from fire, but may not survive flooding. Dry matter
   yields are usually between 1-8 t/ha.
