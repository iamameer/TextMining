   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An unbranched, evergreen palm, reaching a height of 18-30
   m with a stout trunk, up to 22-75 cm in diameter, covered with
   persistent leaf bases. The tree has adventitious roots growing from the
   bottom one meter of the trunk, and a few deeply penetrating roots that
   anchor the tree, but most of the roots grow horizontally in the top one
   meter of the soil, and as far away as 20 m from the bole. The stem
   terminates in a crown of leaves at the very top, 70-100 leaves, up to
   7.5 m long, are produced in spiral succession from the apical meristem.
   The inflorescences are compound spikes, one borne in the axil of each
   leaf. The palm is monoecious and male and female flowers do not appear
   on the plant at the same time. Cross-pollination therefore almost
   always occurs. After fertilization, the female inflorescence develops
   into the fruit bunch. Each bunch may contain about 200 fruits. A single
   bunch may weigh 18-25 kg, of which 60-65% is fruit. The fruits are
   fibrous drupes about 4 cm long and 2 cm broad, with a pointed apex and
   a leathery, fairly thin exocarp surrounding the fleshy mesocarp, a hard
   endocarp and a seed. USES: Palm oil has saturated palmitic acids, as
   well as oleic and linoleic acids. It can be used in the manufacture of
   soap and candles and in the tin plate industry. It is the most
   productive species for bio-diesel. It contains vitamins A and E. Palm
   kernel oil is very similar to coconut oil and is used in edible fats,
   in the preparation of ice cream and mayonnaise, and in the manufacture
   of soaps and detergents. By tapping the male inflorescence, a wine can
   be made and the central shoot or cabbage of the palm is edible. The
   press cake from palm kernel oil can be used for animal feed. KILLING
   T.: 0^oC at during rest or at early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   FURTHER INF.: Elaeis belongs to the palm subfamily Cocoideae. African
   oil palm is indigenous to the humid tropics of West Africa. It occurs
   wild along the banks of rivers and streams in the transition zone
   between rain forest and open savanna, at latitudes between 3°N and 7°S.
   The cultivation is essentially limited to regions between 10°N and S.
   It can be found up to 1300 m in elevation near the equator. For
   commercial production altitudes above 500-700 m were considered
   unsuitable, but cold tolerance has extended this to 1500m. Growth rate
   is significantly affected below 20^oC and there is no growth below
   15^oC. However, yields should not be significantly affected if the
   temperature drops below 20^oC for a few hours at night only. With cold
   tolerance it can withstand temperatures of 12^oC. It can tolerate
   temporary flooding, provided the water is not stagnant. Photosynthesis
   pathway C3II. Relative humidity should be higher than 75% in areas of
   commercial production and rainfall should be evenly distributed
   throughout the year. It requires adequate light and at least five hours
   of sunshine per day in all months of the year is desirable. Seedling
   growth stops at temperatures below 15^oC. High winds can be harmful.
   CULTIVATION AND POST HARVEST TREATMENT:
   CROPPING SYSTEM: Oil palm can be a useful agroforestry species. On
   smallholdings oil palms are often intercropped with food crops such as
   maize, millet, cassava, cocoyams, groundnuts or bananas. This can be
   done for up to three years. On larger plantations, soil cover crops of
   legumes and grasses are often used. PROPAGATION: The plant is
   propagated from seed, that, however, germinate irregular and very
   slowly. To hasten the process, the moistened seeds can be mixed with
   charcoal and put in small boxes and then into polythene bags. These are
   laid in so called "germinators" for about 40 days at 38-40°C in low
   relative humidity. Then the seeds are allowed to absorb water and are
   held at 28-30°C for another 10-40 days. Seeds can also be germinated at
   the above temperature but without bags, then they should be watered
   every three days. A wet sack on the floor can help to keep the
   atmosphere damp. About 80% of the fresh seeds and 50-60% of stored
   seeds will germinate, but not at the same time and each week the
   germinated seeds should be removed. PRE-NURSERY: The germinated seeds
   are fragile and should therefore first be planted in prepared beds,
   trays, baskets or bags before being transferred to the field nursery.
   Soils for the pre-nursery should be well-drained, friable, fertile
   topsoil. The beds should be 20-23 cm high and not more than 120 cm
   wide. The trays 120 x 60 cm and 15-20 cm deep, while the baskets and
   polythene bags should be 23 cm deep and 10-15 cm in diameter. The
   sprouted seeds are planted carefully at a distance of 7.5 x 7.5 cm,
   their delicate roots pointing downwards and covered with 2.5 cm of
   soil. After 4-6 months, when the seedlings reach the 4-5 leaf stage,
   they are transferred to the field nursery FIELD-NURSERY: Here the
   seedlings are planted at a distance of 75-90 cm apart or in large
   polythene bags. They remain in the nursery 6-12 months before being
   transplanted to the field. The nursery area should be flat and near a
   water source. The soil should be as in the pre-nursery and organic
   manure should be incorporated before planting. FIELD: Seedlings should
   be between 10-18 months when they are transplanted to the field. It is
   best to move the seedlings with a substantial ball of earth (35-45 cm
   in diameter around their roots). When bare-root planting is necessary
   the roots should be dipped in a clay slurry as soon as they are lifted.
   Some leaf pruning may be necessary to reduce the seedlings height to
   about 1.2 m. The optimum planting density is about 123-140 palms per
   ha, which is the same as a planting distance of 8-9x9 m. New compact
   hybrids developed by ASD Costa Rica allow up to 170 palms per ha with
   corresponding yield increases due to the compact canopy; harvesting is
   also simplified due to their lower height. In areas with seasonal
   rainfall the transplanting should be done at the beginning of the rain,
   while in areas with a better rainfall distribution it can be done year
   round. LAND PREPARATION: The area around the planting holes should be
   cleared of all vegetation to a radius of 1 m. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. Begins to bear in 3-4 years, is in full production in 8-10
   years and is usually cut down at 25-35 years, when the palm gets to
   tall and unpractical to harvest. Specimens have been known to live 200
   years. The inflorescence develops in the apical bud for two years.
   After pollination fruit takes 150-180 days to mature. The tree requires
   a growing period of at least 270 days per year, the optimum is more
   than 300 days and the tree can grow throughout the year. FERTILIZATION:
   One ton of fruit removes about 6 kg N, 1 kg P, 8 kg K, 0.8 kg Ca and
   0.6 kg Mg from the field. Typical fertilizer recommendations in West
   Africa would be: 114 g of N, P2O5, K2O and Mg in 1:1:1:2 per seedling
   in the nursery, 15 kg N, 24 kg K2O, 4 kg Mg per hectare at
   transplantation, 15 kg N, 45 kg K2O, 7 kg Mg per hectare in the first
   year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 60 kg K2O, 10 kg Mg per hectare in
   the second year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 75 kg K2O, 17 kg Mg per
   hectare in all subsequent years. The fertilizer should be applied in a
   ring 7.5-15 cm from the seedlings and about 1.5 meter from the mature
   palm. IRRIGATION: Required in the early stages and later during dry
   periods. WEED CONTROL: An area around each palm and a passage between
   the palms should be kept free of vegetation. For mature palms the
   vegetation free area should be about 2.5 m in diameter. PEST AND
   DISEASES: With good care and careful selection of plants, disease
   control in the stand is not usually necessary. Where there is danger
   from rodents young plants should be protected by a wire collar. The
   principal diseases of oil palm are blast, freckle and anthracnose.
   Common pests are palm weevils, leaf miners, slug caterpillars, but also
   rats, porcupines, wild pigs, elephants and palm-nut vulture can damage
   the palms. HARVESTING: The fruit bunches are cut off or knocked down
   when the fruit is ripe. The correct time for harvesting is in most
   cultivars indicated by the change in colour from black to orange or by
   the fall of the first individual fruits. Usually only one bunch on the
   tree ripens at a time. The ripe bunches should be cut very carefully to
   avoid damage to the subtending leaf. YIELDS: It produces the two
   distinct oils, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is obtained from
   the fleshy, orange mesocarp of the fruit, which contains 45-55 % oil,
   and palm kernel oil is obtained from the kernel or endosperm which
   contains about 50% oil. The best plantations yield about 30 t/ha of
   fruit per year. From that, about 7 tons of palm oil and 0.8 tons of
   kernel oil can be extracted. Oil palms can give a higher yield of oil
   per unit area than any other crop. In older plantations the yields are
   however often only about 3.5 tons oil per ha. per year. POST HARVEST
   TREATMENT: The fruit bunches are almost always damaged during harvest
   and must be taken to the factory as soon as possible and should be
   processed within 24 hours.
