   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, monoecious shrub reaching 1-3 m in height
   at maturity. The canes reach 1-2 cm in diameter. USES The stems provide
   a highly waterresitant fiber with a greater tensile strength than
   cotton. The fiber is used in twine, thread, and other flax and hemp
   products, and is spun as grasscloth or Chinese linen. The tops and
   leaves are palatable, high in protein, and can be fed to livestock.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. There are an increase in yields in the 2nd
   and 3rd year. Stems can be harvested 2-3 times per year in temperate
   areas, 4-5 times in subtropical areas and in the tropics up to 6 crops
   can be produced anually. The crop is normally replanted after 7-10
   years, but may persist for 20 years. May also be harvested after 45
   days for fodder. COMMON NAMES Ramie, Rhea, China Grass, Ramio. FURTHER
   INF Ramie is native to central and western China. It can be grown
   between latitudes 6-45°N and 9-38°S. It is adapted to a relative air
   humidity about 80%. Both excessive rainfall and drought affects the
   quality of the fibre. Relatively flat areas, not subject to flooding as
   well as gentle sloping lands, not subject to erosion are suitable for
   ramie production. Yields of green plants may in temperate regions vary
   between 15-20 t/ha and in tropical areas 8-10 t/ha. Yields of about
   1400 kg fibre/ha have been reported.
