   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An algae up to 5 cm tall with several tufted,
   entangled, cylindrical, and sometimes arcuate axes rising from a
   decumbent and arcuate axis, up to 500 ÃŠm in diameter, attached to the
   substratum by stoloniferous rhizoids. USES Used for the preparation of
   agar forming hard jellies or eaten fresh, prepared as a salad vegetable
   or cooked and eaten mixed with rice. GROWING PERIOD Its seasonality is
   not well explorated, it is often most frequent in dry or cooler
   seasons. A population can in 6 months grow to 7 times its original
   weight. COMMON NAMES Intip-intip, Kembang karang, Sangau, Culot,
   Gulaman. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Gelidium rigidum, Gelidiopsis
   rigida. Intip-intip occurs in tropical seas all over the world, in the
   algal turf on surf-exposed and moderately wave-sheltered rocks and
   reefs in the lower eulittoral and the sublittoral zone. It is found in
   the tide pools at higher levels on the shore and occasionally found
   growing on shell fragments in shallow water, some water movement is,
   however, needed for growth. Optimum growth takes place at salinity
   levels between 35-40 promille but short-period salinity flucturatins
   between 10-80 promille can be survived.
