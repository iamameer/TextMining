   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a fine evergreen tree usually reaching 20-30 m in
   height but often up to 35 m, with a diameter of 50-80 cm and
   occasionally up to 1 m. The trunk generally straight and well formed.
   USE: The wood is used as pulp for paper and as fuel. However, it throws
   out sparks when burning. It can be tapped for rasin and the bark
   contains tannin. The leaf oil is sometimes used for medicinal baths,
   locally, the seeds may be consumed. In many places where the tree
   grows, the mat of needles on the ground is considered valuable for the
   protection of the soil surface from erosion. In Sri Lanka a massive
   reforestation programme was undertaken with the tree convert heavily
   eroded lands on which nothing else could be grown. It is the only
   species so far successfully used to clothe barren eroded and denuded
   lands with a tree cover. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Caribbean pine, Caribbean pitch pine, Nicaragua pine, pitch pine, slash
   pine. FURTHER INF: It grows best in frost-free areas up to about 700 m
   in more fertile sites with good subsoil drainage and annual rainfall of
   2000-3000 mm. Soils are usually loams or sandy loams, sometimes with
   high amounts of gravel and generally well drained. The pH is usually
   between 5.0 and 5.5. Generally at elevations of 600-800 m it is
   associated with P. oocarpa var. hondurensis and P. oocarpa var.
   ochoterenai. Pinus caribea is rated as moderately fire resistant. It
   tolerates salt winds and hence may be planted near the coast.
