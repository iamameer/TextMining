   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Herbaceous legume with a dense mat of rhizomes
   (mostly in the surface 5-7 cm of soil), 3-5 (up to10 mm) in diameter,
   radiating from a deep, woody taproot. Stems erect to decumbent,
   unbranched. Leaves tetrafoliolate, glabrous to sparsely pubescent.
   Flowers sessile, up to 10 cm long, 15-25 mm wide, yellow, soft orange
   to brilliant orange without red veins on back. KILLING T: Although tops
   are cut by frost, plants re-grow vigorously with the onset of warmth
   and moisture. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. USE: Used in intensively
   grazed pastures, for hay and silage production, and agroforestry (e.g.
   under coconuts). Also used for soil conservation (e.g. road verges) and
   as an ornamental. COMMON NAMES: Rhizoma peanut, Arb. FURTHER INF: It is
   native of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay between latitudes 13-28°S, it
   can be grown between 30°N and 35°S. Best suited to areas receiving
   1000-2000 mm per year. It is drought tolerant and can persist in areas
   receiving rain down to 600 mm or up to 4000 mm. Successful on
   well-drained fertile to infertile soils ranging from sands to clays.
   Prefers acid soils growing well down to pH 4.5, but tolerates neutral
   to slightly alkaline soils, some ecotypes growing moderately well at pH
   as high as 8.5. Dry matter yields are normally between 5-16 t/ha.
