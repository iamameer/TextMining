   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb producing a bulb at the base. All parts
   produce a strong onion odour when crushed. Inflorescence may reach a
   height of 30-100 cm. Onions vary considerably in size, shape, color,
   and flavor. USES It is grown for its edible, pungent bulbs, which are
   rich in calcium and riboflavin (vitamin B2). The bulbs can be eaten raw
   or cooked and they are often used for flavoring. GROWING PERIOD
   Biennial, normally grown as an annual, growing 85-175 days. Requires
   two seasons to produce seeds. COMMON NAMES Onion, Common onion, Bulb
   onion, Oignon, Cebolla, Speise-zwiebel, Ui, Sibuyas, Yeung ts'ung tau.
   FURTHER INF Onion is probably indigenous to the mountain lands of
   central Asia where Afganistan, Iran and Pakistan meet. High
   temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed
   production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low
   temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore
   only occur at higher elevations. The production of bulbs is controlled
   by the photoperiod, the critical day-length varies from 11-16 hours,
   depending on the cultivar. A long, dry period is required for bulb
   ripening after the leaves have withered. A cool period promotes early
   leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period,
   but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Bulb
   yields of up to 5-10 t/ha or 0.5-1 kg/mÀù can be obtained. Mentioned as
   a useful agroforestry species.
