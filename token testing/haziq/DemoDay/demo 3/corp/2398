   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, deciduous tree with an round crown reaching
   6-10 m in height. Five year old orchard trees should be 2.5-3 m high
   with 6-8 leaders. The fruit is a globose, reddish-yellow drupe about 3
   cm in diameter. USES The fruit can be eaten fresh, canned, or dried.
   The kernels are the source of a culinary oil. The expressed oilcake is
   used as cattle fed. Leaves are fed to sheep and goats. KILLING T
   Blossoms and young fruit may not tolerate -1.5°C, while the dormant
   fruit buds may survive -33°C. GROWING PERIOD Perennial tree, that bear
   after 3-5 years, reach full production from the 5th to the 12th year
   and with an economic life of about 30 years. The tree may grow 180-300
   days per year. COMMON NAMES Apricot, Abricotier, Albaricoque, Damasco,
   Aprikose, Badam, Aprikhot, Mo'. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: A.
   vulgaris. Apricot is native of western China. It require 250-300 hours
   of winter chilling to overcome bud dormancy but should not be grown in
   regions with late spring frosts. The water supply must be guaranteed,
   especially in the spring. Excessive nitrogen can cause heavy vegetative
   growth, delay fruit maturity, and uneven ripening. In the tropics, it
   is always grown at high altitudes and in Hawaii, apricot can be grown
   successfully at elevations above 1000 m. Fruit yields range between
   30-50 kg/tree.
