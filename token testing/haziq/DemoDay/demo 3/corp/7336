   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A slender, erect, wiry, greyish-green herb usually with
   blue, sometimes white flowers reaching from 75-120 cm in height. USES:
   The plant provides fiber and oil. Long fibers are used for linen cloth
   and short fibers are used to make cigarette, book, currency paper and
   other fine-textured paper. The oil is used in veterinary medicine,
   paints, varnishes, printer's ink, soaps, painting and varnishes,
   cooking, and the can be applied as a poultice to burns and scalds, or
   used internally as a mild laxative. It is also used in a mixture as an
   antiscaling compound to protect cement. Seed residues are used as
   cattle feed. KILLING T.: Seedlings may survive -6 to -11°C, but mature
   plants may not tolerate frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Unbranched types
   can be harvested 80-140 days from sowing and branched types after
   140-180 days. COMMON NAMES: Flax, Linseed, Lin, Tetard, Lino. FURTHER
   INF.: Flax is most probably native to western Asia. The principal flax
   production area lie between latitudes 49-53°N. It requires uniformly
   moderate to cool temperatures and a relative humidity around 60-70%
   during the growing period. During the period approaching harvest, warm
   dry weather is desirable. A hot dry summer generally produces a short
   and harsh fiber, whereas a moderately moist summer yields fine, strong
   but silky flax. In cool-temperate regions straw yields of up to 6-7
   t/ha and seed yields of about 1 t/ha can be expected.
