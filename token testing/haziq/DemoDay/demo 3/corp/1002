   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An evergreen shrub or small tree reaching 5-10 m in
   height, with a straight low-branched trunk and a dense rounded crown.
   Fruits a globose or ovoid pome 3-8 cm x 2-5 cm, pale yellow to deep
   orange and densely pubescent. USES The sweet-sour, juicy fruits are
   rich in vitamin C, potassium, and carbohydrates, they are eaten fresh,
   cooked, or used for jellies. The juice can be used to prepare an
   alcoholic drink. The seeds are used to flavour (almond-like taste)
   drinks and cakes. Leaves and young branches are used as feed for goats.
   The wood can be used to make stringed music instruments. Fruits and
   leaves have medicinal properties and the flowers have insect repellent
   properties and can also be used in perfume production. It can be grown
   as an ornamental. KILLING T Flowers and young fruit will not tolerate
   frost, while the dormant tree may survive -10°C to -12°C. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Loquat, Japanese medlar, Japan-plum,
   Nispero del Japon, Nespola giapponese, Neflier du Japon, Bibace,
   Lokwat, Papalaan, Ton leap, Lokhwot, Lukuh, Pee-pae, Pi-pa, Biwa, Ti ba
   diep, So'n tra nhatban', Nhot tay. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym:
   Photinia japonica. Loquat is native of the hills of the mild-wintered,
   moist regions of central-eastern and south-eastern China. Loquat's
   cropping season is the winter period, whereas the summer is the season
   of rest. In the tropics the tree is best grown at elevations above 600
   m and in Central America it is common at elevations between 1000-2300
   m. The best fruit quality is however often obtain in regions close to
   the sea. To much or to little sun light is harmful for the quality of
   the fruit. The tree is drought-resistant and for fruit production it
   needs a sheltered site. In India the average fruit yield per tree is
   16-20 kg per year, but yields can be up to about 100 kg per tree.
   Average yield in Japan is about 8 t/ha and the highest yield recorded
   is 25 t/ha in Israel. Pollination is by bees and flies.
