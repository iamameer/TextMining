   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall to very tall evergreen forest tree usually
   40-55 m, but can reach up to 75 m in height, with a trunk diameter of
   120-200 cm or even 300 cm. The form is generally good with a clear,
   straight bole often 1/2 or 3/4 of the tree height. USES The timber is
   used for poles, house construction, boxes, mine timber, veneer, and
   pulpwood. It makes a good firewood. It is an ornamental and shade tree
   and a good source of honey. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry
   species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Can be grown with a 6-15 years
   coppice rotation, or a 20 years timber rotation. The usual rotations in
   Kenya are 6 years for domestic fuelwood, 7-8 years for telephone poles,
   and 10-12 years for industrial fuelwood. Height growth of 2 m per year
   are common. Withstands droughts of up to 3 months. COMMON NAMES Flooded
   gum, Rose gum, Toolur, Rosegum eucalyptus, Turpentine-gas. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: E. saligna var. pallidivalvis. In Australia, the
   tree can be found at elevations from sea level to 800 m, and in Kenya,
   it is grown up to 2700 m. The species is indigenous to eastern
   Australia from northern New South Wales to northern Queensland. The
   tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 16-33Â°S. It can be
   found on flats or lower slopes of deep, fertile valleys. The plant is
   sensitive to boron deficiency, the symptoms being those of drought
   stress, which may be a problem on old tropical soils, however this
   easily cured. Sudden freezing is very damaging for the tree, it is very
   sensitive to fire and have a slight tolerance of salt winds. Annual
   wood production potential is 17-70 m3/ha.
