   KILLING T
   Very frost resistant.
   GROWING PERIOD
   Rather slow growing perennial evergreen tree. First harvest should be
   taken in the 7th to 9th year and then each 7-9 years thereafter. The
   tree probably has an economical life of 50-75 years, though trees exist
   which are said to be 100-150 years old.
   COMMON NAMES
   Cork oak.
   FURTHER INF
   Cork oak is commomly found in the western Mediterranean region. It
   thrive on rocky soils on the lower slopes of mountains. The tree is
   dominantly found at altitudes up to 600 m, although plantings do occur
   up to 1500 m. The optimum altitude is below 200 m. It is best adapted
   to humid climates without extremes. An average of 60-70% relative
   humidity is best, but the tree will tolerate humidity as low as 35% for
   4-5 months. The best harvest is obtained from trees already stripped.
