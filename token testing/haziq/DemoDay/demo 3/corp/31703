   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a dioecious thorny/spiny, shrub, up to 10 m or more
   in diameter and about 0.5-1 m in height, with an erect growth form. The
   leaves are modified into thorns to minimize water loss. USE: The seeds
   are edible and the leaves are eaten as a vegetable. The fruit are
   bitter (due to presence of aglycones) and unpalatable when green, but
   are nonetheless eaten as a survival food. A decoction of the bitter
   roots is believed to cure many ailments. Fresh fruit is said to relieve
   stomach pains, and oil from the seeds moisturizes the skin and protects
   it from sunburn. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Butterpips,
   !nara, Nara melon, Botterpitte, Nara, naras, Narras. FURTHER INF: It is
   adapted to uninhabitable conditions of dune fields with high
   temperatures, violent sandstorms and rainless climate. It grows where
   underground water is available, colonizing shifting sand dunes. It can
   grow on saline, dry soils in hot and arid subtropical climates. Found
   on active dunes, in pans and flat plains. It survives the extreme
   conditions of the desert due to its taproots that are able to grow up
   to 40 m long in search of the water table.
