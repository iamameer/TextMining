   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized to tall tree reaching 30 m in height,
   while the trunk may reach 100-180 cm or even 220 cm in diameter. The
   tree often has a long clear trunk with a relatively small crown. The
   bole is frequently forked. At high altitudes the tree is reduced to a
   stunded, deformed shrub. Sapwood yellow, heartwood pink to reddish with
   distinct closely spaced growth rings, very soft with straight grain and
   fine texture. USES The wood is easily split, has good bending
   properties, works and planes rapidly and is very durable. It is used
   for joinery, in boat-building, for mining timber and it is also popular
   for beehive boxes because it is light and durable. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. The tree can reach an age of 500 years or more. COMMON NAMES
   King Williams pine, King Billy pine. FURTHER INF King Williams pine is
   native of Tasmania. Its latitudinal range is 41.5-43.5Â°S and it occur
   at elevations between 500-1200 m.
