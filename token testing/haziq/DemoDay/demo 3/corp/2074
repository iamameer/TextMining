   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with
   a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When
   fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along
   its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper
   portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched
   lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and
   with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls
   of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves
   arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2
   phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive
   elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth
   is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the
   first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a
   whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of
   the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which
   appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very
   often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy
   arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from
   pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and
   pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves
   are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal
   branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the
   other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous.
   Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long;
   generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base,
   pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very
   short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals
   5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the
   base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands
   adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile,
   alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube.
   Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style
   terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long
   and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong;
   sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with
   10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds
   (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons.
   The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was
   originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod
   develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct
   layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the
   epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and
   hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of
   varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty
   seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield
   in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies
   enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump
   almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both
   sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm
   in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate
   when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose
   viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially
   treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be
   propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting,
   marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean,
   with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa
   butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits,
   chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The
   cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically
   absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is
   low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with Panicum
   maximum and Centrosema pubescens. Fuel: The cocoa bean testa has a
   calorific value of 16 000-19 000 BTU/kg, a little higher than that for
   wood. Lipids: The ash from pod husks contains potassium oxide, which
   can be extracted in the form of potassium hydroxide, a useful alkaline
   in the saponification process. Cocoa-bean fat from unfermented cocoa
   beans can be extracted and used in soap making. Alcohol: The cocoa-pod
   husk can be hydrolysed under pressure for fermentation into alcoholic
   drinks. Medicine: Cacao butter can be used in cosmetics and has medical
   properties. The rural people in Amazonas State, Brazil, rub cocoa
   butter on bruises. Soil improver: There is considerable nutrient
   cycling through the development of a deep leaf litter under the cocoa
   canopy. Intercropping: Cocoa has traditionally been established in
   thinned forest following logging and 1-3 years of food-crop production
   before the canopy closes. Crops such as maize, cocoyam, yams and
   plantain are commonly intercropped with cocoa in Ecuador, Jamaica and
   West Africa. KILLING T.: Temperatures of about 5^oC, even for a short
   period, may damage cacao but it is grown in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where
   normal winter temperatures reach 4-6^oC. The tree is damaged by frost.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial tree, that begins fruiting after 3-5 years
   and bears well up to an age of 30-40 years, or even 60 years in the
   best soils before yields begin to decline. Fruit and seed require
   180-300 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): kokoe, (English):
   cacao, chocolate tree, cocoa, Nicaraguan cocoa shade, (French): cacao,
   cacaotier, cacaoyer, (German): Kakaobaum, (Indonesian): coklat,
   (Khmer): kakaaw, (Malay): pokok coklat, (Sinhala): maikona gaha,
   (Spanish): cacao amarillo, cacao criollo, cacao forastero, (Tamil):
   kona maram, (Thai): kho kho. FURTHER INF.: The generic name comes from
   the Greek ?theos? (god), and ?broma? (food) and means the ?food of the
   gods?. In its natural habitat it is an under-storey plant of forest in
   the wet humid tropics. In most of the producing countries of America,
   Asia or Oceania, permanent shading is provided by specially-planted
   trees, most commonly Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, various
   Erythrinae or even Albizia species. Finally, other industrial crops are
   often used as permanent shading for the cocoa tree, the coconut palm in
   particular. Of other crops there have been several attempts to
   intercrop cocoa trees with rubber, oil palm, areca palm (Areca catechu)
   or even with nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). When planted at their normal
   density, all these plants produce too much shade for the cocoa trees,
   which develop as far as vegetation is concerned, but produce very few
   pods. Cacao originated in the Upper Amazon region in South America. It
   can be grown between 20°N and S, but the bulk of the crop is grown
   within 10°N and S, usually below 300 m in elevation but it can be found
   up to 700 m, and exceptionally up to 1500 m in equatorial regions. The
   photosynthesis pathway is C3. Cacao is best adapted to 75-86% relative
   humidity at 09.0 hours, and 51-72% at 15.0 hours, above this humidity
   level the risk of diseases is increased. Young seedlings have a shade
   requirement for optimal growth, but for the mature crop optimal yield
   can only be obtained under full sunlight. Situations where the
   temperature frequently falls below 18.8 C, or rises above 32.2 C are
   said to be unfavourable. Cacao is sensitive to strong winds. The amount
   of nutrients removed in the harvest is not very high if the fruit
   shells are brought back to the plantation and used as mulch. One ton of
   cacao beans remove about 20 kg N, 4 kg P, and 10 kg K from the field.
   Optimum yield of dry beans is more than 2.0 t/ha, while average yields
   in Africa vary between 0.2-1.0 t/ha. It takes 16-30 kg of pods to
   produce 1 kg of dry cacao. Cacao is naturally out-breeding, and various
   insects are associated with its pollination, the main ones being
   thrips, midges, ants and aphids. It has a complex system of
   self-incompatibility. After successful pollination, fertilization takes
   place within 36 hours; the sepals, petals and staminodes drop away and
   the stamens and pistil wither. The young pod, known as the cherelle,
   begins to develop by longitudinal elongation, followed by increase in
   width. The period between fertilization and pod maturation varies from
   150 to 180 days, depending on the variety. The pod turns light yellow
   when ripe and is ready for harvesting at this stage. Fermented seeds
   are roasted, cracked and ground to give a powdery mass from which fat
   is expressed. Cacao has the distinction of being a birthplace of IPM
   and over the last 30 years cocoa has increasingly become a smallholder
   cash crop. An estimated 80% of the world's cocoa is now produced by
   smallholders.
