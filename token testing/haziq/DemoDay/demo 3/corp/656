   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A deciduous tree reaching a height of 30-40 m or up
   to 60 m. The diameter of the trunk above the 3-4 m tall buttresses
   varies from 100-300 cm. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: West
   Indian cedar. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonyms: C. quianensis, C.
   paraquariensis, C. mexicana, C. occidentalis, C. sintenisii. West
   Indian cedar can be found naturally growing in Mexico, through Central
   America to Argentina. It occurs at elevations from sea level to 1500 m.
   The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 26°N-28°S. In
   its natural area of distribution, it is found in both primary and
   secondary evergreen to semi-deciduous lowland or lower mountain
   rainforest. It demands light and does not tolerate waterlogging or
   flooding. Widely distributed in wet forests of low elevations in
   tropical America. Trees are best planted in regions with very fertile
   soils and with perfect drainage that results in the good aeration of
   the soil required by the root system. Drought for part of the year does
   not adversely affect the health of the tree. In its natural habitat,
   removing trees around the seed tree and gradually opening up the canopy
   in the forest can encourage regeneration. The tree is often found close
   to streams and water requirements may on sites with less than 1200 mm
   of annual rainfall also depend on other sources. Annual wood production
   potential is 11-22 m3/ha.
