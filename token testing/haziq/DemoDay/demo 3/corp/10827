   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Herbaceous legume, with climbing and prostrate stems,
   forming dense mats. Leaves trifoliolate, with leaflets round, 1-9 cm
   long and 1-5.5 cm wide. Inflorescences are axillary racemes, with 2-5
   (-10) yellow, white or blue flowers. Pods (9-) 13-20 (-30) mm long and
   4.5-5.5 mm wide. USE: It is a useful legume in intensively grazed
   pastures, and forms a good ground cover in lightly shaded areas.
   KILLING T: The top is killed by frost but the plant can regenerate from
   the root-stock. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing in the summer.
   COMMON NAMES: Creeping vigna. FURTHER INF: It is native of tropical
   Central and East Africa form from equator to 40°S-N and from sea level
   to 2700 m. Also suitable of subtropical lowland areas. Occurs in
   grasslands, grasslands with scattered trees, thickets, forests and
   sometimes as a weed of cultivation. Often forms a natural mixture with
   grasses such as kikuyu, producing excellent grazing. It can be found in
   areas with from 1000 mm to 3000 mm annual rainfall and with average
   annual temperatures between 17-21°C. It occurs on soils with textures
   ranging from sands to medium clays with pH from 4-7. These soils are
   often infertile and have at least moderate levels of soluble aluminium.
   It requires good soil moisture for performance, but can survive up to a
   few months of dry conditions. It tolerates waterlogged soils, but is
   intolerant of flooding. DM production about 1-4 t/ha/year.
