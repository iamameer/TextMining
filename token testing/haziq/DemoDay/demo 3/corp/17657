   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall evergreen tree reaching 40-50 m in height with
   a straight bole up to 1/2 of the tree height, sometimes slightly fluted
   at the base, up to 150-220 cm in diameter. The trunk has many small,
   rounded buttresses that give the base and elephant-foot like
   appearance. Leaves, simple, leathery, elliptical to ovate, 14-18 x 5-11
   cm. USES The timber is heavy and durable, often used for marine
   constructions such as pilings, wharfs, docs, sluices, dams, ships,
   bridges, but also used for power line poles, masts, roof shingles and
   house posts and to a minor extend as frame, board, heavy duty flooring,
   railway sleepers, fencing material, furniture etc. The fruits are
   poisonous but have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Slow-growing
   perennial. COMMON NAMES Ulin ironwood, Billian, Bilian, Bois de fer,

   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Bihania borneensis. Ironwood occurs
   eastern and southern Sumatra, Bangka, Belitung, Borneo and the Sulu
   archipelago and Palawan. Seedlings require some shade, while older
   trees need plenty of light. It can be found in valleys and on hillsides
   and even on low ridges when soil moisture is sufficient at elevations
   between sea level and 625 m. The standing timber volume of trees with a
   diameter of over 50 cm may be as much as 90-112 m3. (pH and temperature
   estimated by the compiler).
