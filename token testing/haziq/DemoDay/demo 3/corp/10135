   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a thorny shrub or small tree 1-9 m in height. Fruit
   spherical, woody shelled, 5-12 cm in diameter, deep yellow to
   yellow-brown when mature, contains many flat seeds. USE: The sweet-sour
   fruit pulp is edible but the seeds and unripe fruit are toxic. Leaves
   are also eaten and used as fodder. Wood is used as timber and firewood
   and charcoal. Juice from the fruit and roots is dropped into the ears
   as a remedy for earache; the roots, leaves and bark are used in the
   treatment of disorders of the male organs. A decoction of the roots is
   taken orally for colds or is drunk with milk to cure dropsy. Roots or
   green fruits are used by the Zulu of South Africa as an antidote for
   snakebite. The roots alone provide an emetic and also a remedy for
   fever and inflamed eyes. An analgesic is made from a decoction of the
   leaves. Jigger fleas are removed from the feet after applying a paste
   in which the grated root is mixed with oil. Oil extracted from the root
   is applied to the skin as a fly repellent. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: elephant orange, monkey ball, monkey orange, natal
   orange, spiny monkey ball. FURTHER INF: Occurs in savannah forests all
   over tropical Africa and grows in open woodland and sandy riverine
   fringes.
