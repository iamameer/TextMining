   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect, annual branched cruciferous herb, up to 1-2 m tall
   depending on season and plant density, branching mostly in the upper
   half; leaves large, ovate in outline, pinnately lobed, progressively
   smaller upward; inflorescence a long panicled raceme, the lateral
   branches of which are sharply ascending and shorter than the primiary
   axis. The penetrating tap root can reach depths of over 15 cm enabling
   the plant to be relatively drought resistant later in the season.
   Flowering indeterminate; flowers small, whitish (typically the
   flowering period is about 3 weeks); pods numerous, spherical,
   one-seeded capsules of about 5mm diameter each containing a single
   spherical seed greenish-brown in colour and 0.8-2.6 mm diameter,
   indehiscent; seed interior yellow. First-formed pods usually remain on
   stalk until last-formed pods mature. One plant may produce 530-1,840
   fruits. USES: Crambe appears to be a better potential domestic crop
   than rapeseed. It is the cheapest source of erucic acid, which performs
   better than any known material as a mold lubricant in continuous steel
   casting. Test plantings in Russia, under a wide variety of ecological
   conditions, gave oil contents of 25-33% for seed with hulls (dehulled
   seeds reached 54%). There are reported yields of 169-840 kg/ha in
   Indiana, 2,000 in Missouri, suggesting oil yields of about 60-600
   kg/ha. Hull-free seeds contain about 26% protein. Crambe meal is used
   as plywood and rubber adhesive, as a source of protein isolates, and as
   an additive to waxes. Crambe meal, after unpalatable material is
   removed or made inactive, may be used as supplement for ruminants not
   to exceed one-third to one-half of the supplement; it is not
   recommended for pigs and poultry. The meal is also used as an
   insecticide. It is used in crop rotations for alleviating weed, pest
   and disease build-up. GROWING PERIOD: Annual, From planting to harvest
   requires about 100 days, but this may vary considerably. It has been
   adapted as a spring crop. KILLING TEMP: Seedlings may survive -4 to
   -6°C for short periods, but at all later stages of growth -1°C may kill
   the plant. COMMON NAMES: Crambe, Colewort. FURTHER INF.: Crambe is
   probably a native of western Asia. It can be grown at elevations
   between sea level and 2000 m or even up to 2500 m in Kenya. Hail can
   cause severe damage to crambe, though it generally will recover. Seed
   yields vary widely from 1,125-1,624 kg/ha in Russia and 450-2,522 kg/ha
   in the United States, with yields highest in weed-free fields. In
   irrigated fields with additional nitrogen, yields up to 5 MT/ha have
   been attained. Cost of production is about the same as for barley. The
   major problems are weed control and seed-shattering.
