   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a stout herbaceous plant reaching 80-200 cm in
   height, often forming dense patches by rhizomes, sparsely to moderately
   clothed with stinging hairs. Leaf blades ovate to lanceolate, often
   conduplicate, mostly 5-15 cm long, 2-8 cm wide. USE: Young leaves can
   be cooked as a potherb or be dried for winter use. They are very
   nutritious and easily digested and are high in minerals (especially
   iron) and vitamins (especially A and C). Cooking the leaves, or
   thoroughly drying them, neutralizes the sting, rendering the leaf safe
   to eat. Plants are extracted of the chlorophyll, which is used as a
   green colouring agent (E140) in foods and medicines. A tea is made from
   the dried leaves. The whole plant is antiasthmatic, antidandruff,
   astringent, depurative, diuretic, galactogogue, haemostatic,
   hypoglycaemic and a stimulating tonic. Externally, the plant is used to
   treat skin complaints, arthritic pain, gout, sciatica, neuralgia,
   haemorrhoids, hair problems etc. A strong flax-like fibre is obtained
   from the stems. The plant matter left over after the fibres have been
   extracted are a good source of biomass and have been used in the
   manufacture of sugar, starch, protein and ethyl alcohol. Oil obtained
   from the seeds is used as an illuminant. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Stinging nettle. FURTHER INF: The leaves of the plants
   have stinging hairs, causing irritation to the skin. It can be found in
   waste ground, hedgerows, woods, meadows, and along sunny and shady
   edges. Prefers a soil rich in phosphates and nitrogen.
