   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous shrub or tree reaching 3-9 m in height.
   There are 2 recognized varieties Ë† P. g. var. torreyana (Benson)
   Johnston grows primarily in the deserts and drylands of southwestern
   USA and northern Mexico; P. g. var. glandulosa is found from Mexico
   north to Kansas and east to Louisiana. USE: The pods and the gum from
   the bark are edible, pods and leaves are used as fodder and flowers are
   a source of honey. Wood is used as firewood, charcoal and timber. It
   has been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, including lice
   control and treatment of sore throat, skin sores and ulcers. Reported
   to be a collyrium, emetic and laxative, it is a folk remedy for
   dyspepsia, eruptions, hernias and skin and umbilical ailments. The tree
   is used for shade, shelter, erosion control, as a support and fence and
   for agroforestry. It can fix atmospheric nitrogen and the fallen leaves
   are soil improving. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Trees can grow rapidly
   and yield over 5 t/ha/yr. COMMON NAMES: Honey mesquite. FURTHER INF:
   Moderately salt and frost tolerant. It thrives under high temperatures
   and survives in areas with very low precipitation but is usually found
   in areas with groundwater reserves. In its drier, western range, it
   occurs along streams and in low-lying areas. In areas with more
   rainfall, it occurs on open range or in chaparral. It has a very deep
   root system (up to 18.3 m) that can extract moisture from the water
   table. It often grows in dense thickets near desert washes but also
   occurs at the base of sand dunes and other areas where the water table
   is close to the surface. A long period of consistently low daily
   minimum temperatures during the winter provides the tree with the
   chilling requirement that facilitates early bud break. Once the
   chilling requirement is met, relatively warm minimum daily temperatures
   can hasten bud break.
