   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION Small to medium-sized evergreen tree.
   Var."equistifolia" is a smallish tree 8-16 m high to a tall tree
   reaching up to 30 m or more, with a tall stem to 20-50 cm in diameter
   and a narrow crown. Var."incana" is a small tree, 6-10 m high. USES It
   produces a very good firewood and charcoal. The wood can also be used
   for fenceposts, poles, house posts, rafters, beams, mine timber,
   roofing shingles, tool handles, oars, wagon wheels, and pulpwood. The
   bark can be utilized for tannin and dye and it has medicinal
   properties. The tree is planted for erosion control, dune
   stabilization, land reclamation, windbreaks, hedges, and as
   ornamentals. It is mentioned as a possible agroforestry species.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Can be grown with a rotation of 8-15 years
   for fuelwood. The tree has a lifespan of about 25-50 years. COMMON

   synonym: C. littorea. In the tropics, coast she-oak can be grown at
   altitudes from sea level to 1500 m. The tree occur naturally within the
   latitudinal range of 12-31.5°S and 18-22°N. In India, young trees may
   grow up to 3 m/year, 25 year old trees may reach 30 m, and the tree may
   reach a total height of 50 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3. The tree has
   become a weed in southern Florida. It can only be grown in areas with
   an annual rainfall between 200-300 mm, if ground water is available,
   not deeper than 3-4 m. The tree can withstand waterlogging for short
   periods, but growth is inhibited by compacted soil layers. It can
   withstand salt spray, it is termite resistant and fixes nitrogen.
   Optimum yield of wood is 200 t/ha, on a rotation of 7-10 years. Annual
   wood production potential is 5-20 t/ha. The tree can exhaust the soil
   moisture, lower the ground water table, and degrade soils by its thick
   litter of branchlets.
