   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized to tall evergreen tree up to 10-45 m
   in height, with a trunk diameter of up to 100-230 cm. The trunk is
   often short, rarely more than 1/2 the tree height. The crown is well
   developed and rather dense, with large, spreading branches. USES The
   timber is used for construction, railway boxcars, wagons, trucks,
   insulator pins, fenceposts, stakes, and formerly shipbuilding. It also
   makes a good firewood. It is planted to stabilize sand dunes, for
   windbreaks, soil protection and as a street and shade tree. It is a
   source of honey. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. For firewood production, rotations of 7-10 years are
   used. Withstands droughts of 4-6 months. COMMON NAMES Tuart, Tooart.
   FURTHER INF Tuart can in tropical and subtropical regions be found at
   elevations from 500 to 2000 m. The species is indigenous to the areas
   around Perth in western Australia. The natural latitudinal range in
   Australia is 31-34Â°S. It can be found on flat as well as on hilly to
   undulating country. A maximum annual wood production of 44 m3/ha have
   been obtained on irrigated fertile soils in Morocco. On more normal
   sites, annual productions of 6-15 m3/ha are typical. The tree is
   termite resistant and tolerates salt winds. It is fire tender when
   young.
