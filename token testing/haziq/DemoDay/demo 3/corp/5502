   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized to tall tree reaching up to 48 m in
   height, with a cylindrical bole, branchless up to 15-20 m and up to 150
   cm in diameter. Leaves broadly elliptical-oblong, usually 16-28 x 7-17
   cm USES The timber is used for medium to heavy constructions but it is
   not very durable in contact with the ground. When treated with a
   preservative the timber can also be used outdoors. Because of its
   resinous nature it is less suitable for flooring and woodwork exposed
   to the sun, or to be painted. It is used for veneer, plywwod, paper
   pulp and charcoal. An oleo-resin can be extracted and used as a coat
   for waterproofing paper, as a varnish for boats, walls and furniture.
   The oleo-resin and also the bark of the tree have medicinal properties.
   KILLING T Tolerant to below 5Â°C. GROWING PERIOD Perennial evergreen
   tree. In India flowers appear from June-July to November and the fruits
   ripen from January to March. COMMON NAMES Hollong, Hullung, Keruing
   gunung, Palahlar minyak, Jati olat, Keruing gunong, Chhe: ti:el prenh,
   Yang-khuan, Tian kahon. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: D. retusus, D.
   trinervis, D. pubescens. Hollong can be found at elevations between sea
   level and 610 m. It will withstand shade in the early stages. The tree
   is fire sensitive.
