   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A creeping herb up to 20-40 cm tall with white
   flowers. USES It is cultivated for an essential oil extracted from the
   flowers. The oil is used in alcoholic beverages, confectionery,
   desserts, perfumes, and cosmetics. Medicinally, the oil is thought to
   have antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, sedative, and stomachic
   properties. Flowers are dried and used in herbal teas and they can be
   used in the brewing of herbal beer. The plant is also grown as an
   ornamental ground cover. KILLING T Chamomile is not particurlarly
   sensitive to frost during the winter, but spring frosts may cause
   damage to the plant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial with an economical life
   of 3 to 4 years. COMMON NAMES Chamomile, Roman Chamomile, Camomile,
   Garden Chamomile. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Chamaemelum nobile.
   Chamomile is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, mainly Portugal,
   France and Algeria. The water requirement is high, especially at the
   time of root development and in the initial period of thrick growth and
   stem emergence. The expected yield of fresh plant is 4-6 t/ha, or
   200-250 kg/ha of flower drug, or 3-5 kg/ha of essential oil in the
   first year. In the following years it is 10-12 t/ha of fresh plant, or
   400-600 kg/ha of flower drug, or 6-10 kg/ha of essential oil.
   Excessively firm, water bearing areas and loose sands are not good for
   the cultivation of chamomile.
