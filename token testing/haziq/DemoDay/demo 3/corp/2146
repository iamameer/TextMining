   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, stiff, glabrous, herbaceous legume reaching
   30-180 cm in height. The stem is stout, square and hollow. The plant
   has a vigorous tap root, leaves with 2-6 leaflets, white flowers with
   purple markings and fleshy green pods, up to 30 cm in length containing
   2-6 seeds. USES It is grown for food, fodder and hay. The young
   immature seeds are cooked as a vegetable. The mature seeds are baked
   and eaten like peanuts, ground for adding to soups or used as animal
   feed. They are rich in minerals, calcium, phosphorus and vitamins. The
   plant can also be grown for green manure. KILLING T Spring cultivars
   may survive -10°C but are damaged by late frost. GROWING PERIOD Annual,
   that provides groundcover in 75-90 days, flowers after 79-90 days, and
   mature in 100-150 days. Immature pods can be 100 days from sowing, and
   beans after 120-150 days. COMMON NAMES Broad Bean, Horse Bean, Field

   northern Europe, it is probably native to the Mediterranean region or
   southwestern Asia. It can be grown in the tropics as a winter crop or
   at high elevation but most cultivars are not adapted to low evaluation
   and pods are rarely produced here. In the tropics altitudes of between
   1200-2500 m with a diurnal variation in temperature are preferable.
   Average yields of dry beans are in UK, winter beans, 3.1-4.37 t/ha,
   spring beans, 2.5-3.75 t/ha, Peru, 1.5-2.25 t/ha and Marocco 1.1-1.6
   t/ha. Experimental yields of more than 7.0 t have been reported. Yields
   of fresh green pods vary from 11.25-12.5 t/ha and 25 t/ha have been
   reported. The plant can reach a height of 0.6-2.0 m. It require medium
   humidity. Photosynthesis pathway C 3.
