   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small slow growing, shrubby, deciduous tree
   reaching 6-15 m in height, with a short, crooked trunk and a branched
   crown. The leaves are ovate-orbicular to elliptic, 5-25 cm long and the
   fruits are quadragular-blobose berries, resembling a tomato,
   yellowish-green to red. USES The soft ripe fruits can be eaten fresh or
   be processed into ice-cream, jam, jelly, etc. Some astringent cultivars
   can be made into a dried product, not unlike dried figs. Kaki-tannin is
   used for cloth, paper, rice wine and it has medicinal properties.
   KILLING T The dormant tree may not survive -18°C. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. It may begin to fruit four years after planting. Fruits
   mature about 7 months after bloom. COMMON NAMES Kaki, Kaki persimmon,
   Persimmon, Japanese persimmon, Chinese persimmon, Oriental persimmon,
   Plaqueminier, Raquemine, Kesemek, Buah kaki, Buah samak, Tonloep, Phlap
   chin, Thi, Hong. FURTHER INF Kaki most probably originated in China. It
   is not successful in the moist tropical lowlands, but can be grown at
   elevations above 1000 m. The tree does not require high relative air
   humidity but irrigation is needed in regions with rainless summers.
   Sheltered sites are important to prevent wind damaging the tender young
   foliage and to prevent blemishes occurring on the fruit. The tree have
   some winter chilling requirements to overcome the dormancy period.
   Annual fruit yields may be about 220 fruits per tree or 20-50 t/ha from
   8-year-old orchards.
