   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized usually evergreen tree
   reaching a height of 5-25 m and a trunk diameter of 30-80 cm. It
   branches low and form a widespreading, dense, and ovoid crown. USES
   Seeds and leaves yield the insect repellent azadirachtin. The tree
   itself is used for shade and shelter, windbreak, and as an ornamental,

   bark has a high tannin content. Oil extrated from the seeds can be used
   in soaps, disinfectants, drugs, cosmetics, and as a lubricant. Seed
   residue are used as fertilizer. GROWING PERIOD Perennial, usually
   evergreen tree, growing 150-210 days per year. The tree can reach a
   height of 4-7 m after 3 years, and 5-11 m after 8 years. In West
   Africa, it is usually grown on a fuelwood rotation of 8 years.

   Antelaea azadirachta, Melia indica, M. azadirachta. Neem is indigenous
   to the dry forest areas of India, Parkistan, Sri Lanka, Malaya,
   Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. It can be found at altitudes between
   sea level and 1500 m and it occur naturally within the latitudinal
   range of 10-25Â°N. Optimum wood yield of 8-year-old trees is 169 m3/ha
   and the annual wood production is 5-18 m3/ha. The tree is drought
   hardy, it regenerates rapidly and it is shade tolerant in youth. It
   needs control, for it may aggressively invade neighboring areas and
   become a weed. It will not grow on seasonally waterlogged soils or in
   deep dry sands where the dry-season water table lies below 18 m. Apart
   from the deep root system the tree also has lateral roots that may
   extend up to 15 m away from the trunk.
