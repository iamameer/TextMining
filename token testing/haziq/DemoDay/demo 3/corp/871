   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb with a slender, swollen orange or reddish
   taproot. The root varies in length from 5-25 cm. In the second year the
   plant may produce an inflorescence and reach 20-100 cm in height. The
   inflorescence is a compound umbrel and the small flowers are white or
   pink. USES The roots are eaten fresh, cooked, or pickled as a vegetable
   and pressed for juice, canned, or dehydrated. They are a good source of
   carotene, vitamins, and sugar. An essential oil is extracted from the
   seeds and used for flavoring and in perfumes. GROWING PERIOD Biennial,
   normally grown as a cool-season annual. Carrot seeds are small and
   germinate slowly, and the tiny seedlings require some time to become
   established. Baby carrots can be harvested after 60-80 days, while
   full-size carrots require 70-150 days. It requires two seasons to
   produce seed. COMMON NAMES Carrot, Queen Anne`s lance, Carotte
   Potagere, Zanahoria, Mohre Karotte, Peen, Gajar, Bortol. KILLING T
   Leaves will not tolerate -1.5°C. FURTHER INF Carrot is native of Europe
   and parts of Asia. In the tropics, carrot should be grown at altitudes
   above 500 m for commercial production. Humidity should be moderate.
   Optimum temperature for germination is 15-25°C, maximum is 35°C. In the
   seedling stage the plants are sensitive to both high and low
   temperatures. Many young plants may be injured or killed on hot, sunny
   days. Long periods of hot weather often cause a strong flavor and cause
   root texture. Temperatures below 10°C tend to cause longer, more
   slender, and paler roots. Pale roots are also produced at temperatures
   above 25°C. Heavy clay soils tend to cause restricted root development
   and forked roots. Short days may reduce the ·-carotene content of the
   roots. Photosynthesis pathway C3.
