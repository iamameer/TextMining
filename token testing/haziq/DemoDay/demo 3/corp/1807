   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herbaceous vine climbing by twining, typical
   trifoliate leaves, with white to purple flowers, tuberous roots,
   distinctive pods with four edges prolonged into thin wings, and round,
   hard seeds. USES It is grown for its pods, seeds, tuberous roots, young
   leaves, shoots, and flowers. The pods are a minor source of protein and
   oil, while the seeds are good sources of protein and an oil taht is
   similar to soyabean oil and can be used for culinary purposes,
   illumination, and soaps. Seeds are also a source of an industrial
   mucilage. Expressed oil cakes are fed to livestock. Ripe seed can be
   eaten after parching. Roots are eaten as a vegetable. Flowers are fried
   and eaten. Plants are also grown for green manure, cover, and fodder.
   GROWING PERIOD Short-lived perennial, normally grown as an annual. The
   first green podsare produced 50-80 days from sowing and harvesting may
   continue for a considerable time. The seeds may take up to 180-270 days
   to become mature. Mature tubers may be harvested from 120-240 days from
   sowing. COMMON NAMES Winged bean, Goa bean, Asparagus pea, Four-angled
   bean, Manilla bean, Princess pea, Four-cornered bean, Mauritius bean,

   Winged bean is well adapted to the lowland humid tropics, although a
   dry period is favourable to fertilization and the production of mature
   pods. It can however be grown in the tropics at elevations up to 2100
   m. Normally a daylength of 12 hours or less is required for flower
   initiation but some cultivars are daylength neutral. Itcan be grown
   between 29°N and 32°S. The species is probably indigenous to New Guinea
   and Southeast Asia. The plant require trellising. Yields of edible pods
   may be up to 25 t/ha, seed yields range from 0.7-4.5 t/ha, and yields
   of tuber 2-6 t/ha. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
   Photosynthesis pathway is probably C3.
