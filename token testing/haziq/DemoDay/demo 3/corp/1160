   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A shrub or small tree with creamy white flowers that later
   turns pink or red. The fibers are 2.2-3 cm long. USES: Its
   fiber-covered seeds are harvested for the manufacture of cotton
   textile. The seeds are pressed for oil used in cooking, in the
   manufacture of margarine and for other culinary purposes. Low-grade oil
   is used in the manufacture of soap, lubricants, sulphonated oils and
   protective coatings. The protein-rich, expressed oilcake is fed to
   livestock. Low-grade cake is used as manure. The whole seed may also be
   used as cattle feed. Cotton seed hulls are used as roughage for
   livestock and as bedding and fuel and also dry stalks are used as fuel.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial or annual, usually cultivated as an annual
   growing 150-220 days. COMMON NAMES: American upland cotton, Upland
   cotton, Cotton, Coton, Kapas, Bulak, Pernambuko, Krabas, Fay hua, Faai,
   Bong se. FURTHER INF.: American upland cotton is native of Central
   America and southern Mexico. In the tropics, it can be grown at
   altitudes between sea level and 1500 m or even up to 2200 m. It
   performs best in desert climates, under irrigation. Low temperature
   increases the production of vegetative branches and extends the
   cropping period, while high temperature increases the number of
   fruiting branches and reduces the cropping period. Commercial cotton
   production extends from 47째N to 32째S. Upland cotton is sensitive to
   high winds and heavy rains. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. Seed-cotton
   yields vary between 0.8-3 t/ha, or 0.2-1.1 t/ha of fibre.
