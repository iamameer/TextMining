   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is handsome and majestic feather palm reaching 5-20 or
   even 30 m in height. USE: The heart of the palm, located in the last
   four feet of the trunk before the base of the leaf stems, is considered
   a delicacy. It can be cut pieces and eaten raw. In a survival
   situation, also the inner bark is edible but much tougher than the
   heart itself. The fruits are eaten fresh and made into sweet meats.
   Also the seed can be eaten fresh. Palm wine is produced from the heart
   of the palm and its sap. The fruits are used as livestock feed. The
   bark can be fed to pigs and chickens. The seeds yield oil which is used
   extensively as a lubricant, for cooking, soap making and lamp oil. The
   leaves are used as thatching material for roofs. It is one of nature's
   largest and most majestic palms. It is very well suited for plantings
   on campuses, parks and public gardens. Even young trees may be planted
   in areas receiving full sun and are very resistant to wind damage.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Cohune palm, Rain tree,
   American oil palm. FURTHER INF: It occurs naturally in Central American
   tropical rainforests in Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa
   Rica, and coastal southern Mexico. It grows best in a sheltered warm
   spot in a subtropical setting, or in hot and humid tropical
   environments. Mature and established plants have been reported to
   tolerate temperatures down to -4 to -5Â°C, losing 10%-100% of their
   foliage but recovering during warmer months. It is not tolerant of
   forest fires, the mortality either being the result of direct damage or
   indirect damage such as increased pathogen access through the fire
   damaged bark.
