   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree reaching usually 4-10 m rarely up
   to 30 m in height, heavily branched with a spreading, umbrella-shaped
   or rounded crown. Bole typically curved or crooked. Bark greyish-brown
   to dark brown. Fruit a drupe, smooth, spherical, oval tipped, fleshy,
   1.3-1.5 cm long. USE: Fruits are edible and leaves are used as fodder.
   Wood is used for timber and fuel. It provides good bee forage, as the
   flowers yield plenty of nectar. Beehives are often placed in the trees.
   The fresh, juicy bark is used to tie a broken bone; this splint is
   changed occasionally with a fresh one until the bone is healed. It is
   used for shade and as an ornamental. Leaves provide good mulch. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Sudan teak, Sebestier d'Afrique,
   Wanza, Wanzey, Wonsa, Wodessa, Auheh, Ehki, Auchi, Auhi, Diho, Madir,
   Awehe, Bout, Wadicho, Mokoto, Mokota. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonyms:
   C. sebestena, C. abyssinica, C. holstii, Varronia abyssinica,
   Calyptracordia abyssinica. It occurs at medium to low altitudes, in
   woodland, savannah and bush, in warm and moist areas, often along
   riverbanks. It is frost tender. It will grow in drier conditions but
   thrives in good rainfall areas and is scattered in occurrence. It
   occurs in afro-mountain rainforest usually along margins and in
   clearings. It is an early colonizer in forest regrowth. It is often
   left when forests are cleared for cultivation, as the tree is an
   excellent shade tree for crops. Also found in riverine forest and
   secondary bushland, transgressing into humid types of woodland. It can
   be found at elevations from 550-2700, but best grown between 1700-2300
   m.
