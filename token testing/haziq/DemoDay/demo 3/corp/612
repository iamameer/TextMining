   is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen in October.

   obtained by rasping the root to a pulp, then washing and straining to
   get rid of the fibres. The very young tubers are eaten cooked, they are
   sweet but fibrousy. Roots contain about 25% starch. The root has
   demulcent, diaphoretic and diuretic properties and is used for women's
   complaints. A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making paper.
   The leaves are harvested in late summer after the plant has flowered,
   they are scraped to remove the outer skin and are then soaked in water
   for 2 hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 24 hours with
   lye and then beaten in a blender. They make a light tan brown paper. A

   valleys of the Andes. It can be found in woodland, cultivated beds,
