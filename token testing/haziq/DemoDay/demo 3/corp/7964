   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb, floating or prostate near water's edge. It
   has a thick taproot, up to 150 cm long, rarely branched stems. Under
   favourable conditions young shoots may elongate at a rate of 5-7 cm per
   day. USES Young shoots are eaten as vegetables, raw, cooked, or fried.
   Extracts from roots and stems have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial, sometimes grown as an annual. Its cropping period is 4-6
   months. COMMON NAMES Water mimosa, Neptunie potagere, Kemon, Keman air,
   Keman gajah, Tangki, Kanhchhnaet, Kas'eed, Phakkrachet, Phakchit.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: N. natans. Water mimosa is widely
   distributed in the tropics of both hemispheres. It is a common floating
   plant in and around fresh water ponds, swamps and canals at low
   elevations up to 300 m. When the water level falls, it perish. The
   plant prefers 30-80 cm deep slow-moving water, full sun and hot and
   humid conditions. Shade, brackish water and saline soil adversely
   affect plant growth. Yields of 30000-50000 shoots/ha for each harvest
   has been reported. Water mimosa is often grown in rice fields and its
   rain and temperature requirements have been estimated from the climatic
   requirements of rice.
