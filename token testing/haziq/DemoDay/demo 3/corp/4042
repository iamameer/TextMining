   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small leguminous tree or shrub reaching a height of
   1.5-12 m often with 3-5 or more small crooked stems 5-30 cm in
   diameter. The tree is evergreen in humid climates and semi-deciduous in
   areas with a long dry season. It has handsome purplish-red flowers in
   10-30 cm long clusters. USES The tree is utilized for erosion control
   on slopes and stream banks, for rehabilitation of degraded lands, it is
   browsed and used for fodder, as green manure, as a firebreak, shade,
   and as an ornamental and hedge plant. The wood can be used as firewood
   and charcoal and the tree is a source of honey. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Seedlings grow quickly up to 2.5-3.5 m in 180 days and up to
   3-5 m within the first year. The tree can provide an annual firewood
   crop for 15-20 years. The sterm turns bittle around the age of 12
   years, but the rootstock remains vigorous and new sprouts are easily
   formed. It tolerates a dry season of 3-6 months. COMMON NAMES
   Calliandra, Caliandra, Cabello de angel, Pelo de angel, Canilla,
   Carboncillo, Kaliandra. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: C. confusa, C.
   similis. In its native Central American habitat, between latitudes
   8-15Â°N, callaiandra can be found at elevations up to 1800 m, but
   normally it is found to about 1300 m. On Java it is cultivated at
   altitudes between 150-1500 m, however, it seems to perform best between
   250-800 m. The tree is drought hardy, it fixes nitrogen and regenerates
   rapidly. It is so hardy and reproduces so easily that it may become a
   weed of sorts and may be difficult to keep in check. It perform well on
   dry to moist sites and is often found on steep hillslopes. Annual wood
   production potential is 5-65 m3/ha.
