   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A small, creeping, stoloniferous grass with narrow leaf
   blades about 2.5- 3 cm long and 5 mm wide and a bluish colour. Sward
   can grow to 20 cm high with very dense leaf if not grazed. USE:
   Primarily used as a lawn grass and withstands heavy defoliation. Used
   for pasture it is very palatable. As a pasture grass, it has invaded
   native pastures under heavy grazing pressure, generally on lighter
   sandy soils. Withstands heavy grazing by horses. As a lawn or golf
   course grass, it is generally laid as turf. Some use as ground cover in
   higher rainfall areas. Also used for erosion control. KILLING T:
   Becomes frosted but recover. GROWING PERIOD Summer-growing perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Seragoon grass, Queensland blue couch grass, Blue couch.
   FURTHER INF: Synonym: Panicum tennuissimum. It is native of the
   Mascarene Islands and Madagascar. It can be found at elevations between
   sea level and 1500 m. Found in areas with 900Ë†1800 mm annual rainfall,
   survives seasonal dry conditions and drought by losing all leaf. Can
   tolerate short-term flooding. Fairly wide soil tolerance but preference
   for lighter soils. It survives droughts well and will also survive
   temporary flooding. Dry matter yields of 11.2 t/ha have been recorded.
