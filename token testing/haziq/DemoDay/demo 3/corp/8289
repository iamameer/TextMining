   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A hardy, perennial rhizomatous caespitose grass; which
   begins growth in late spring. It can grow up to 1.8-2.2 m in height;
   rhizomes elongated; scaly. Culms 60-300 cm long. Culm nodes glabrous,
   or bearded. Lateral branches lacking. Leaf-sheaths glabrous on surface.
   Ligule a ciliolate membrane; 1.5-3 mm long. Leaf-blades 10-60 cm long;
   3-15 mm wide. Leaf-blade surface glabrous, or pilose. Foliage - tinged
   with red. Inflorescence an open ovate panicle15-55 cm long. Spikelets
   solitary. Fertile spikelets pedicelled. Spikelets comprising 1 basal
   sterile florets; 1 fertile floret; without rhachilla extension.
   Spikelets ovate; dorsally compressed; 3-5 mm long; falling entire.
   Glumes reaching apex of florets; thinner than fertile lemma. Lower
   glume ovate; clasping; 0.66-0.75 times length of spikelet; membranous;
   without keels; 5 -veined. Lower glume apex acuminate. Upper glume
   ovate; 1 times length of spikelet; membranous; without keels; 7-veined.
   Upper glume apex acuminate. Basal sterile florets male; with palea.
   Lemma of lower sterile floret similar to upper glume; ovate; 1 times
   length of spikelet; membranous; 5 -veined; acuminate. Fertile lemma
   ovate; dorsally compressed; 2.5-3.5 mm long; indurate; pallid; shiny;
   without keel. Lemma margins involute. Lemma apex acute. Palea involute;
   indurate. Anthers 3. Fruit is a caryopsis with an adherent pericarp.
   USES: It is a cultivated range and fodder grass and is grazed by
   certain animals, used as ground cover to control erosion and farmed as
   forage for livestock. As a drought resistant ornamental grass, it is
   easily grown in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade.
   Establishment is recommended in the spring, at the same time as maize
   is planted. It can also be used for silage and as an energy substitute
   and is often considered a good candidate for bio-fuel, especially
   ethanol fuel production, due to its hardiness against poor soil and
   climate conditions, rapid growth and low fertilization and herbicide
   requirements. It has the potential to produce the biomass required for
   production of up to 380 liters of ethanol per metric ton. This gives it
   the potential to produce over 400 liters of ethanol per hectare,
   compared to 270 for sugarcane and 160 for corn. However, there is
   debate on the viability of switchgrass, and other bio-fuels, as an
   efficient energy source. University of California, Berkeley professor
   Tad Patzek argues that switchgrass has a negative ethanol fuel energy
   balance, requiring 45 percent more fossil energy than the fuel
   produced. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial; warm season; sod forming; slow
   spreader. FURTHER INF.: Switchgrass uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it
   an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. As an open
   pollinated species, switchgrass expresses tremendous genetic diversity,
   with wide variations in its basic chromosome number (2n = 18),
   typically ranging from tetraploid to octoploid. Morphologically
   switchgrass in its southern range can grow to more than 3 m in height,
   but what is most distinctive is the deep, vigorous root system, which
   may extend to depths of more than 3.5 m. It reproduces both by seeds
   and vegetatively and, with its perennial life form, a stand can last
   indefinitely once established. Standing biomass in root systems may
   exceed that found aboveground, giving perennial grasses such as
   switchgrass, an advantage in water and nutrient aquisition even under
   stressful growing conditions. Distribution; Asia-temperate: Soviet
   Middle Asia and China. Pacific: north-central. North America: western
   Canada, eastern Canada, northwest USA, north-central USA, northeast
   USA, southwest USA, south-central USA, southeast USA, and Mexico. South
   America: Mesoamericana, Caribbean, and Brazil.
