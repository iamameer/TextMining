   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A plant with large long-petioled leaves arising to
   30-60 cm from a poorly developed basal corm. USES The leaves and stems
   are eaten. The leaves can be boiled or added to soups; the stems are
   cut into about 1 cm long pieces, then boiled. They can be serve
   separately on the same plate as two different vegetables. A little
   vinegar added after cooking or oil, butter and salt improves the
   flavour. It is important to thoroughly cook the stems of this plant
   since they contain calcium oxalate crystals which cause the mouth and
   throat to sting. Can be canned as spinach. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   First harvest can be taken after 6-8 weeks. COMMON NAMES Belembe,
   Tahitian taro, Calalou. FURTHER INF Belembe is native of Brazil. It
   must be planted in a rich, damp, organic soil to grow well. It does
   well in flooded or poorly drained areas where other crops cannot grow.
   Leaf yields may be 20-50 t/ha. (pH estimated by the compiler).
