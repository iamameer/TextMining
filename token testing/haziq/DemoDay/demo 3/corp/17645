   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, spreading, evergreen tree reaching a height
   of up to 20 m, although grafted trees usually are 8-10 m tall. It has a
   low branched trunk and an irregular, densely foliated crown. Fruits are
   7-20 cm long and 7-10 cm in diameter with a large seed. They may be
   round, oblong, pear shaped or bottle necked, green or may be tinged
   with purple. USE The pulp is used as a fresh salad fruit. The pulp can
   be frozen, used in guacamole and various sauces, and as a flavor in ice
   creams. The pulp contain 3-30% of an edible oil similar to olive oil.
   The unripe fruit is poisonous and the ground-up seed mixed with cheese
   is used as rat and mouse killer. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species. KILLING TEMP The Guatemalan group may tolerate -4.5Â°C, but
   trees will not tolerate frost during the flowering period. GROWING
