   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A deciduous, rigid, woody shrub, 1-2m tall, with stems
   typically branching in threes and terminating in spine-like tips. USE:
   It is a hardy species, rarely killed by intensive browsing or drought.
   Mismanagement and overgrazing initiate the multiplication of this
   species in areas which would otherwise be denuded of vegetation. In
   these situations it ensures a plant cover which protects the soil from
   wind and water erosion, provides sheltered sites for the establishment
   of seedlings and provides a reserve fodder bank in times of drought.
   Young roots are chewed for diarrhoea. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Three-thorn, Kalahari soap bush. FURTHER INF: Indigenous to the
   arid western regions of southern Africa in Botswana, Namibia and the
   Northern Cape province of South Africa. An unpalatable species which is
   becoming increasingly invasive in arid rangelands as a result of
   overgrazing. Spreads very effectively by vegetative propagation.
   Prefers sandy and calcareous soils on plains, dune valleys and near
   pans and dry rivers. The distribution area of three-thorn falls within
   a summer rainfall area and the mean annual rainfall ranges from about
   50mm in the south to about 350mm in the north-east. Rainfall is highly
   erratic, with a coefficient of variation of 54% and prolonged droughts
   are common. The wettest months are usually later in the summer, from
   January to April, when ambient temperatures and evaporative water
   losses are high.
