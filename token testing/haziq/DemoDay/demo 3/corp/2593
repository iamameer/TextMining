   oil wells. An other extract called katha are used in betel chewing and
   has medicinal properties.

   and durable and is used for house posts, agricultural implements,
   wheels, firewood, charcoal, etc. The tree is a host for lac insects.

   occurs naturally in mixed deciduous forests and savannas of lower
   mountains and hills. In the sub-Himalayan tract from the Indus to
   Assam, it is found at elevations up to 1000-1500 m. In Australia, it
   occurs at altitudes from sea level to 520 m. It prefers sites with a
   high water table. Some places it is cosidered a most undesirable tree.
   It spreads rapidly on fallow land and in pasture, particularly on
   low-lying fertile alluvial soil along drainage lines, and is expensive
   and difficult to eradicate. In India, the yield of heartwood range
   between 50-75 m3/ha giving a yield of cutch about 4-6 t/ha.
