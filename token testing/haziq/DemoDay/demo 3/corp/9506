   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen shrub or small tree reaching 6-7 m in
   height. Leaves oblong-elliptic to almost circular, 3 x 7 cm, light to
   dark green, rather fleshy. Fruit spherical, fleshy, 5-10 mm in
   diameter, pink to scarlet when mature, single seeded. USE: The fruit
   can be eaten raw, cooked, or dried and stored, leaves and young shoots
   are browsed by all stock and the flowers are a source of honey. The
   wood is used as firewood and charcoal. The seed contains a non edible
   oil that is an alternative source of oil for soap and detergent
   industries. Toothbrushes are made from roots and small branches. A
   decoction of the root is used to treat gonorrhoea, spleen trouble and
   general stomach-ache. Roots are also used for chest diseases or pounded
   and used as a poultice to heal boils. The bark is scratched and the
   latex used for treating sores. Seeds are used as a tonic, and seed oil
   is used on the skin for rheumatism. The tree is planted for shelter, as
   a windbreak and planted for sand dune reclamation and is also useful
   for reclaiming saline soils. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Toothbrush tree. FURTHER INF: It is widespread, notably in thorn
   shrubs, desert floodplains, river and stream bank vegetation, and
   grassy savannahs. Prefers areas where groundwater is readily available,
   by riverbanks, on perimeters of waterholes, in seasonally wet sites,
   and along drainage lines in arid zones. Also found in valleys, on dunes
   and on termite mounds. The tree is able to tolerate a very dry
   environment with mean annual rainfall of less than 200 mm. Highly salt
   tolerant, it can grow on coastal regions and inland saline soils.
   Prefers clays but is found on loam, black soils and sand. Adapted to
   alkaline or very saline soils, usually clay-rich, and soils without
   salt.
