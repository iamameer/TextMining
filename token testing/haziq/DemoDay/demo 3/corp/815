   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A variable, trailing, softly hairy vine. The fruit is
   variable in size, shape, rind, and colour. A plant should be permitted
   to carry about 4 fruits. USES The fresh flesh of the fruit is eaten out
   of the rind after removal of the seeds as dessert, often with a little
   sugar or powdered ginger. The fruits of some cultivars are used as
   preserves and as vegetables. The seeds are edible and the yield an
   edible oil. It is mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. GROWING
   PERIOD Annual. Fruits may be ready for harvesting 50-120 days from
   sowing or planting. COMMON NAMES Muskmelon, Cantaloupe, Melon, Casaba,
   Sweet melon, Rockmelon, Blewah, Semangka londo, Bluwak, Milon, Itimon,
   Atimon, Trasak sroo'w, Teeng laay, Teeng suk, Taeng-thai, Taeng-lai.
   FURTHER INF Muskmelon prefer moderate to low humidity, but is has
   relative high water requirements and are often grown with furrow or
   drip irrigation. High humid conditions may reduce growth, adversely
   effect fruit quality and encourage leaf diseases. Best growth is
   obtained in periods of high temperature with little diurnal variation,
   but in many cultivars the sugar content is increased by low night
   temperatures. Each plant is usually allowed to bear about four melons,
   and a crop of melons should yield about 5-30 t/ha, with an average
   about 11-13 t/ha. The species is believed to be indigenous to Iran and
   India or Africa. In the tropics it can usually be grown at elevations
   from near sea level to 1000 m, in Java it is grown at elevations
   between 300-800 m.
