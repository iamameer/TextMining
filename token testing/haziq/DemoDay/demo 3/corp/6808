   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A stoloniferous grass, with robust, erect or ascending
   culms 1-2.5 m high and to more than 12 mm thick, and prostrate stems
   that run on wet ground, or float on water, developing adventitious
   roots. Leaves glossy green in colour, sheaths often spongy; blades
   mostly linear-lanceolate, 10-45 cm long and to more than 3 cm wide.
   Panicle narrow, spikelike, cylindrical, 20-50 cm long, 8 mm diameter.
   USE: A cool or dry season forage in seasonally inundated land, and can
   also be cut for silage and as green feed. It is proposed as a nutrient
   sink and sediment trap in situations polluted by habitation and
   cultivation. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Wick grass, Dal
   grass. FURTHER INF: Occurs from about 29ºN in Florida and 19ºN in
   Mexico to about 28ºS in Argentina, mostly at altitudes below 850 m, but
   reportedly to 1500 m with a range in average annual temperatures of
   21-26ºC, with some frost incidence at the extremes. It is widespread
   throughout South-East Asia. It is a wetland species, inhabiting margins
   of swamps, peat swamps, river floodplains, and drainage canals, mostly
   in water to about 2 m deep, occasionally extending into water 3-4 m
   deep,but is better adapted to seasonal immersion than to permanent
   water. It can become a troublesome weed in irrigated rice. It can be
   found from sea level and up to 1200 m in elevations. Yields of fresh
   material from 4-24 t/ha may be obtained.
