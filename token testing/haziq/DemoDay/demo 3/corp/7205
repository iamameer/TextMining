   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A diminutive floating aquatic perennial, often forming a
   solid cover on the surface. USE: It is grown as feed in aquatic
   rice-based ecosystems in Cambodia and China. Their high fat and protein
   content makes them a source of food for animals and poultry. It has
   potential in wastewater treatment, absorbing excess nutrients from
   surface waters, including phosphorus and ammonias, reducing suspended
   solids, and reducing biochemical oxygen demand. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial or annual. COMMON NAMES: Lesser duckweed, Common duckweed,
   Duck's meat FURTHER INF: More cold tolerant than other aquatic vascular
   plants, and can sustain temperatures as low as 7ºC for normal,
   practical growth. Under freezing conditions, it will lay dormant on the
   pond bottom until warmer conditions return. A full, thick mat of
   duckweed may have a temperature of about 10ºC above ambient air
   conditions due to radiation. Can recover from winter temperatures down
   to -40°C. Plants may over winter as turions, or as seeds, sinking and
   resting at the bottom of the pond until they germinate. Spreads rapidly
   across quiet bodies of water rich in nutrients, growing best in water
   with high levels of nitrogen and phosphate, but will also grow in
   eutrophic water. Iron is often limiting. Wind and wave action can
   impede duckweed growth and stabilization by disrupting their ability to
   attach themselves to each other and form their characteristic
   homogenous colonial populations. Optimal conditions for growth are
   quiet streams and ponds.
