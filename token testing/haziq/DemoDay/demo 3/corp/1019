   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall fast-growing evergreen tree reaching a height
   of 35-80 m and a diameter of up to over 200 cm. The bole is usually 1/2
   to 3/4 of the tree height. USES The timber is suitable for flooring,
   furniture, boat building, light and heavy construction, particle board,
   veener, plywood and pulpwood. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. The tree may
   reach 44 m in height in 15 years. Can be grown on 20 years rotations
   for sawlogs, or on 6-7 years rotations for pulpwood. COMMON NAMES
   Mindanao gum, Kamarere, Bagras, Leda, Kaju Leda, Aiala, Kayu kawan,
   Banikag, Amamanit. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: E. multiflora, E.
   naudiniana, E. schlechteri. Mindanao gum can be found at elevations
   from sea level to 2500 m. The tree occur naturally within the
   latitudinal range of 10°N-11°S. The tree is adapted to areas with
   summer rainfall, but it does not grow well in regions with a pronounced
   dry season. It is commonly found in lowland rain forests habitats along
   rivers, on cleared or disturbed areas, eg. landslide areas, vulcanic
   blast areas or old shifting cultivation sites. Optimum annual wood
   production is 14-50 m3/ha. The tree very susceptible to fire,
   intolerant of drought and young trees are brittle and easily damaged by
   strong winds. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. A pulpwood
   plantation may yield 200-300 m3/ha at 10-12 years of age and a 20 year
   old plantation managed for sawlog production may yield about 520 m3/ha
   from trees up to 55 m tall and with a diameter of about 50 cm in breast
   height.
