   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous plant reaching up to 30 cm in height.
   The stem is branching, and the leaves many-cleft and sessile. The
   flowers are large, yellow, and attractive. USE: A toxic principle is
   present in very small quantities in the plant. It is poorly absorbed so
   poisoning is unlikely. The plant contains cardiac glycosides similar to
   those found in the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea). These substances
   improve the heart's efficiency, increasing its output at the same time
   as slowing its rate. It also has a sedative action and so is generally
   prescribed for patients whose hearts are beating too fast or
   irregularly. The herb is not often prescribed, however, due to
   irregular absorption. The herb is cardiotonic, diuretic, sedative and
   vasoconstrictor. It has sometimes been used internally as a cardiotonic
   with success where the better known foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) has
   failed - especially where there is also kidney disease. The herb is
   also used in the treatment of low blood pressure and its strong
   diuretic action can be used to counter water retention. It is included
   in many proprietary medicines, especially since its effects are not
   cumulative. The plants are harvested every third year as they come into
   flower, they are dried for use in tinctures and liquid extracts. The
   herb does not store well so stocks should be replaced every year. The
   plant is used in homeopathy as a treatment for angina. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Pheasant's eye. FURTHER INF: It can be found
   in eastern South Europe and into Russia. Naturalized in north-eastern
   United States. Found on sunny grassy hills on dry calcareous soils. A
   rare plant in most of its range, it has legal protection from gathering
   in most countries.
