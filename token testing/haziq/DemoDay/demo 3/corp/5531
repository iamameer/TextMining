   trunk may reach 120 cm in diameter. The stem is usually relative
   straight and the crown quite small and compact. Sapwood pale, heartwood
   pale-yellowish grey or brown, with fine texture, usually straight
   grained, not very fissile due to its tendency for brittleness, fairly

   durable. It is used for small tool handles, interior linings and
   mouldings, cabinets and turnery. The wood peels well and the veneer is
   often used for corestock. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
