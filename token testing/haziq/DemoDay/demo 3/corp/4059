   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: It is a tree or shrub usually 2 m or less, but can
   be up to 5 m tall, with erect or spreading branches, or a stunted,
   irregularly branched tree, sometimes several-stemmed, occasionally
   glaucous. Leaves 2-4 mm long. Female cones solitary or several together
   on stout, often clustered fruiting branchlets, remaining on branches
   long after maturity, ovoid to depressed-globose, 20-35 mm in diameter.
   The cown is very dense and dark green. USES: Provides firewood.
   Aborigines on the Murray River made a combined canoe pole and fish
   spear nearly 4 m long from the wood of the tree, called by them
   Maroong. The resin was also a cement for fastening barbs to spears.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Mallee pine. FURTHER INF: In
   Australia, its latitudinal range is between 27-35Â°S. (pH estimated by
   the compiler).
