   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a bushy, multi-stemmed, wide-spreading shrub with
   deciduous compound leaves. It gets 3-4.5 m tall with a similar spread,
   and its brittle branches are pithy and soft. It often forms dense
   thickets, a result of suckering from the roots. The leaves are
   opposite, pinnately compound (feather-like), and up to a 30 cm long.
   There are 5, 7 or 9 saw-toothed leaflets, each about 5-15 cm long. The
   star-shaped white flowers are tiny, but arranged in showy sprays up to
   25 cm across. The edible fruits are shiny blue-black berry-like drupes
   with 3-5 stoney seeds. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. USE: The bush can be
   used as an ornamental, it is best in the naturalized or wildlife
   garden, in wet areas of the landscape, and along roads. The flowers are
   used to make elderflower water which is used in perfumes and
   confectioneries. Raw elderberries have an unpleasant taste and contain
   small amounts of poisonous alkaloids. Cooking destroys the alkaloids
   and improves the taste. (The dried berries are said to be good to eat
   raw, however.) Cooked elderberries are made into pies, jellies, and of
   course, elderberry wine. The flowers are also edible, and used in jams,
   jellies and are the basis of elderflower fritters. COMMON NAMES:
   American elder, Eastern elderberry, American elderberry FURTHER INF: It
   is native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Florida, and
   west to Minnesota and Texas, where it occurs in rich soils along
   riverbanks and forest edges.
