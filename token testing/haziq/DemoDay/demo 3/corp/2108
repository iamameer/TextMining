   elongate ovoid borne both terminally and in the axils of leaves,
   many-flowered, purple or rarely white, 9-18 x 7-13 mm. USE: Regarded as
   a good legume for grazing in native pastures with potential for use as
   an annual legume for pasture improvement in high altitude areas. An
   excellent species for bee keeping and honey production. Produces long
   stems that give good cover for soil erosion control. GROWING PERIOD:
   Annual or short-lived perennial. COMMON NAMES: FURTHER INF: Found in
   grasslands and riverine margins in southern and eastern Central Africa.
   Rainfall in its natural range varies from 1200-1600 mm/year. Adapted to
   the cool frost-free highlands of tropical Africa at altitudes of
   1600-2700 m. It grows well in lower altitudes in grasslands where there
   is sufficient moisture. Well adapted to a wide range of soil types from
   lighter acid sandy-loams to clays. It can tolerate heavy clay vertisols
   and waterlogging.
