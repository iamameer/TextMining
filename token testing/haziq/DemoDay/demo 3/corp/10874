   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 8-18 m in height, with a
   heavy rounded crown and a clear bole up to 5 m. Bark rough, pale brown
   or greyish-white, rather smooth with narrow vertical fissures. Leaves
   opposite, glabrous, 14-34 cm long, usually with 5 leaflets on stalks
   6-14 cm long. Fruit oblong, about 3 cm long. Green when young, turning
   purplish-black on ripening and with a starchy black pulp. USE: The
   fruit is sweet and tastes like prunes. The leaves, pods and seeds are a
   good fodder. The wood is whitish to light brown, teak-like,
   termite-resistant, quite hard and suitable for light building material,
   furniture, carvings and boats and also as firewood and charcoal. The
   bark yields a dye that can be used for cloth. The fruit is used to
   improve fertility and to treat anaemia, jaundice, leprosy and
   dysentery. The root is used for gonorrhoea, and women drink a decoction
   of it for backaches. The young tender leaves are pounded and the juice
   squeezed into the eyes to treat eye troubles. The tree is grown for
   shade and as a bounder tree. It has nitrogen-fixing roots and fallen
   leaves make a good mulch. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Black plum. FURTHER INF: It is the most abundant and widespread of the
   genus occurring in savannah regions. A forest tree of coastal woodland,
   riverine and lowland forests and deciduous woodland, extending as high
   as upland grassland. Requires a high water table. It occurs on a
   variety of soils of varying origins, usually alluvial soils.
