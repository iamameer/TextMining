   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub or small tree reaching a height of 2-9 m. It
   often has a large umbrella shaped growth habit. Berries are small, red
   when ripe. USES Beans are used in the production of instant coffee.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. KILLING T 5-7°C are the
   lowest temperatures tolerated for long periods. More sensitive to cold
   than C. arabica, and killed by frosts. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Begin
   to bear in 3-4 years, yield increases to 14 years, and the economic
   life of the plant is 20-80 years (average 50 years), with declining
   yields. The tree may live as long as a hundred years. Growth cycle
   270-300 days. It may tolerate 21-30 days of mild drought. COMMON NAMES
   Coffee robusta, Congo kafe, Cafe, Kaffee. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: C. robusta. Robusta coffee is native of West Africa and the
   equatorial African rain forests. It can be grown at altitudes of about
   1100-1300 m in equatorial regions, and down to sea level at 11°N and
   13°S, which is also its the normal latitudinal range. Robosta is a more
   vigorous and hardier species than arabica. Photosynthesis pathway C3.
   With to much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of
   flowers and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates
   uniform flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not
   desirable. It will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. For
   best growth and development the relative humidity should be between 70
   and 90% and periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial, but require
   a drier period of 1-2 months for initiation of flower buds. Neither
   lack of wind nor strong winds are desirable. Strong, dry, hot or cold
   winds, hail and heavy rain cause damage. The species can be grown in
   shallow soils in high rainfall areas and will stand temporary
   waterlogging. Well managed plantations may produce up to 2 t/ha of
   fresh berries.
