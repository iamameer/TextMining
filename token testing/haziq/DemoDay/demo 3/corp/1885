   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A grass with unbranched culms, erect or reclinning,
   hard stems, and with little juice reaching up to 10 m in height. USES
   It provides raw sugar, though the sucrose content is low and the fibre
   content very high. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter
   mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock
   fed, and for the manifacture of fiberboard, paperpulp, plastic,
   furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for
   industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of
   industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as
   fertilizer. Cane wax are used in the production of furniture, shoe, and
   leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper.
   KILLING T Long-term exposure to temperatures below 10Â°C may be lethal.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial, growing 10-24 months, but most often it is
   grown 14-18 months for the plant crop and 12 months for the ratoon
   crop. COMMON NAMES Sugar cane. FURTHER INF Robustum sugar cane is
   native of New Guinea, where it is commonly found along riverbanks
   forming dense stands. Photosynthesis pathway C4.
