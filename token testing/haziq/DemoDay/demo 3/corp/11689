   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Small to medium sized leguminous tree reaching 5-18 m in
   height with an open spreading crown. Considerable diversity in
   morphology. Leaves bipinnate with 11-22 (5-30) pairs of pinnae,
   variable in length up to 35 cm. Flowers are variable in colour,
   pinkish-grey to rose pink or occasionally pale violet. Pods 7-11 cm x
   13-23 mm, glossy reddish-green or maroon. USE: The edible pods are used
   in time of need. Trees are commonly retained in cropping lands and has
   been used as a shade over coffee, generally in frost-free
   highland-tropical locations. Has been extensively evaluated in
   agronomic and, to a lesser extent, in animal production trials. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Guaje. FURTHER INF: Found through out
   Mexico and Central America typically between 700-2000 m in elevation.
   Occurs in frost-free climates with average annual temperatures from
   17-22ÂºC and is poorly adapted to high temperature environments. Its
   native range receives 1000-1800 mm annual rainfall and has a wide range
   of soils from limestone-based vertisols to mildly acid infertile
   alfisols. Grows under pine forests and is therefore likely to possess
   shade tolerance.
