   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A large monocarpic unbranched herb. The pseudostem is
   often markedly swollen at the base. The fruit is dry and inedible. USES
   The thickened pseudostems and swollen underground stems are eaten
   cooked or fermented, usually after it has been made into bread. Fiber
   from the stems is made into cordage and sacking. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. The plants are harvested after 3-4 years before the
   formation of the inflorescence which would use up the starch. COMMON
   NAMES Enset. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: E. edule. Enset is native
   of Africa. It occurs naturally in montane forest and riverine forest,
   often in clearings, gullies and near streams. In Ethiopia it occurs
   naturally between (500ˆ)1000ˆ1600(ˆ2400) m altitude. In cultivation it
   occurs at altitudes from 1600ˆ3100 m, but scattered plants can also be
   found at lower altitudes. However, it grows best at elevations between
   1800 m and 2450 m. Climatic conditions at higher elevations, especially
   low temperature and frost, hamper the growth of the crop and its
   maturation may take twice as long, or even longer, than in lower
   regions. Established enset plants can tolerate periods of drought and
   frost. In Ethiopia, food security is better in enset-based farming
   systems than in cereal-based ones. Monthly mean temperatures of 16ˆ20°C
   are optimal, but growth is acceptable from 5ˆ25°C. For optimum growth
   enset requires an average annual rainfall of 1100ˆ1500 mm. Although it
   needs a well-distributed rainfall at the early stages of growth and a
   fairly. Enset grows well in most fertile and well- drained soils. Best
   growth is obtained in moderately acidic to alkaline (pH 5.6ˆ7.3) with
   2ˆ3% organic matter.
