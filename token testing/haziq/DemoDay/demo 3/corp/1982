   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A single-stemmed grass and cereal crop reaching a height
   of 1-5 m; it is usually taller than grain sorghum. It has a strong root
   system and a layer of heavy disilicate covers the epidermis of the
   root. As the root grows to maturity it forms an entire silicon column;
   which provides it with enough mechanical density during a drought
   period to prevent the root system from collapsing. It has fibrous,
   spreading roots and consists of a primary, secondary and supporting
   roots. The primary root is developed from the seed embryo. It is the
   only embryo root produced by the seed during germination. Before the
   production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by
   which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop
   roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which
   a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single
   radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all
   adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral
   roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to
   at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90
   cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important
   factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the
   effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and
   sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many
   secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant
   produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the
   stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly
   protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135
   cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the
   sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres
   closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad,
   strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy
   powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions,
   the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and
   thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an
   apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an
   oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and
   embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered
   by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc.
   The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark
   brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that
   of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between
   16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to
   159,000/kg for grass sorghum). USES: The versatility of sweet sorghum
   resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and
   Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the "Four F's Crop" for sweet
   sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference.
   The "Four Fs" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum,
   namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D has concentrated on
   maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties,
   whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar
   producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction
   of R&D towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the
   potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar
   production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to
   be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new
   technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to
   extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into
   flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be
   manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes,
   and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to
   livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The
   inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties
   and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine. GROWING
   PERIOD: Annual or short-term perennial grass. Most sorghum plants take
   90-120 days to mature, the boot stage is reached in 50-60 days,
   flowering in 60-70 days and full grain maturity in 90-120 days. COMMON
   NAMES: Sorghum, Sorgho, Sorgo, Great millet, Milo, Jowar, Cholam,
   Guinea corn, Durra, Mtama, Jowal, Jolar, Cholam, Koaliang. FURTHER
   INF.: Lowland tropical sorghums are adapted to warm days and night
   temperatures above 22째C throughout the growing season. The poisonous
   glucocide 'dhurrin' in sorghum is present from germination, increasing
   to a maximum and then disappearing as the grain develops, so that in
   the later stages the plants is safe as fodder. New long day varieties
   exist. The photosynthesis pathway C4III. The species is probably
   indigenous to North-East Africa, north of latitude 10째N and east of
   longitude 25째E. Sorghum is grown between 40째N and S. Sweet sorghum can
   be found at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, most East African
   sorghum is grown between the altitudes of 900-1500 m, and cool-tolerant
   varieties are grown between 1600 and 2500 m. The nutrient removal for 1
   ton of grain is about 50 kg N, 9 kg P, and 45 kg K, calculated from the
   above-ground plant mass. Grain yields of up to 4 t/ha can be obtained,
   but in the driest areas, the yield usually varies between 0.3-1.2 t/ha,
   and the global average is about 1.3 t/ha. Like the common grain
   sorghum, sweet sorghum can produce grain yields of 1500-7500 kg/ha. But
   the essence of sweet sorghum is not from its seed, but from its stalk;
   which contains sugar. In general, the stalk yield is 45000-75000 kg/ha.
   The sugar content in the juice of sweet sorghum varies in different
   varieties. It's Brix ranges generally from between 15-23%.
   Genetic resources: There is a wide varaition in seed type from Beijing
   Botanical Garden's sweet sorghum germplasm collection. ICRISAT is
   involved in diversification of sorghum breeding populations, and
   ultimately cultivars available to farmers, through the incorporation of
   traits and genetic materials that have not previously been used in crop
   improvement. For example, new random-mating populations have been
   produced using diverse germplasm selected for resistance to head and
   stem pests, earliness with high grain and biomass yield, tillering
   ability, large grain and resistance to grain molds. ICRISAT initiated a
   program for the identification and development of sweet-stalked and
   high-biomass sorghum hybrid parents and varieties in 2002. Promising
   lines such as ICSB 631 and ICSB 264 among the seed parents; and Seredo,
   ICSR 93034, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSV 93046, E 36-1, NTJ 2 and Entry 64 DTN
   among the varieties/male parents were identified for their high stalk
   sugar content. The sugar percentage in these seed parents and varieties
   ranged from 16.8% to 21.6%. Four of these lines, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSR
   93034 and Entry 64 DTN are being evaluated in the All India Coordinated
   Sorghum Improvement Program (AICSIP). A Special/Sweet Sorghum Hybrid
   (SSH) 104 developed from ICSA 38, an ICRISAT-bred male-sterile (seed)
   parent and SSV 84, a male parent bred in India is being recommended for
   release for commercial cultivation. The national sorghum program,
   through extensive testing in AICSIP, released a sweet-stalk sorghum
   variety SSV 84 in 1992/93 for general cultivation. The wide variability
   available in germplasm and hybrid parents for the traits related to
   ethanol production such as percentage of sugar, sucrose and Brix (a
   measure for sugar content in liquids) and high stalk yield offers
   bright scope for the development of high stalk yielding sugar-rich
   varieties and hybrids. The EMBRAPA National Centre of Maize and Sorghum
   Research in Brazil has also developed new sweet sorghum varieties and
   work closely with ICRISAT.
