   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is usually a deciduous shrub or medium-sized tree up to
   9 m tall with a trunk that is frequently crooked; branches spreading,
   often drooping, branching well above ground or near the base. Leaves
   ovate to broadly ovate, 2.5-8 x 1.9-8 cm, shiny, densely hairy to quite
   smooth. Fruit a round, reddish-brown, glossy drupe. Trees with 2 types
   of fruit, the small type 7-10 mm in diameter and the large type 15-25
   mm in diameter, all often remaining on the tree after the leaves have
   fallen. USE: The fruit is eaten fresh or dried, in meal or porridge.
   The young leaves can be cooked and eaten as spinach. Seeds are roasted,
   crushed and used as a coffee substitute. Both leaves and fruits are
   browsed and used as fodder. The flowers are a source of honey. The wood
   is hard and makes good firewood and charcoal. The bark contains 12-15%
   tannin. Roots are used as a remedy for pain and to treat snakebite.
   Boils and other skin infections are treated with leaf paste, and this,
   together with an infusion of the roots, is a treatment for tubercular
   gland swellings, measles, dysentery, lumbago and chest complaints. The
   bark is used as an emetic; bark decoction is used for rheumatism and
   stomach troubles, bark infusion is used to treat coughs, and bark is
   used in a steam bath to purify the complexion. It is planted as a
   living fence. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Cape thorn.
   FURTHER INF: It grows in areas dominated by thorny vegetation in both
   temperate and tropical climates. Also found in open scrubland,
   woodland, forest margins and riverine vegetation. It is a very hardy
   species, most common in dry areas; it is resistant to both frost and
   drought. Tolerant to shallow soils, seasonal waterlogging, salt spray
   and soil salinity. Regarded as an indicator of underground water.
