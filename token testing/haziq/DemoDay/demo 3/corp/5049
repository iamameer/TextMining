   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Monterey cypress is an evergreen coniferous tree that is
   columnar or cone shaped when young, but becomes broad and spreading as
   it ages. Specimens subject to constant sea breezes and salt spray are
   twisted and contorted. In a grove, away from the seaside, it develops
   into a tall, straight tree, that can get over 15-30 m tall with a trunk
   diameter of 2.5 m. The tiny leaves are scale-like, adpressed to the
   branchlets and lemon scented. They grow in erect or spreading feather
   like plumes. KILLING T: Frost resistant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Monterey cypress. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: C.
   hartwegii. Monterey cypress grows best in areas with mild climates,
   winter rain and cool ocean breezes. It tolerates acidic to slightly
   alkaline soils, and does best in sandy soils. It is susceptible to a
   fatal canker disease in hot, dry regions. It can be found at elevations
   from sea level to 3500 m. The tree occur naturally within the
   latitudinal range of about 36-37Â°N. The tree is very wind firm and
   tolerates salt winds and is an excellent choice for seaside plantings
   where it becomes wind swept and develops a striking irregular shape.
   Smaller cultivars (such as 'Goldcrest') are grown in containers. It is
   used extensively for bonsai. The twisted and gnarled form that makes
   bonsai specimens so attractive comes naturally to Monterey cypress.
