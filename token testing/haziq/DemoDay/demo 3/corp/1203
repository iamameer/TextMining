   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A grass with 30-150 cm high, compressed, culms , decumbent
   at first, but later ascending, rooting from the lower nodes, often
   branched, with green, smooth, glabrous, 5-15 (-20) cm long and up to 6
   mm wide, usually folded leaf-blades, and with a creeping, branched
   rhizome. Inflorescence comprising single spike 5-12 cm long. USES:
   Highly palatable, used as pasture, withstanding heavy grazing, fodder
   and can also be used for silage. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial grass
   growing from early spring to late autumn. COMMON NAMES: Limpo grass,
   Red vlei grass, Rooik week, Swamp couch, Halt grass. FURTHER INF: It is
   native of tropical Africa. Occurs over a wide latitudinal range from
   about 40ºN to 34ºS, and from near sea level to 2000 m. It is common in
   flooded areas, swamps and lakes. It will not tolerate fire but can
   withstand short, seasonal dry periods, but does not tolerate long
   droughts. Grows in soils of any texture, providing moisture is
   adequate. It tolerates acid soils down to pH 4.5, but is best between
   5.5 and 6.5. Heavy frosts (-13°C) can kill some plants, with some
   differences among cultivars in winter-hardiness. Some genotypes can
   survive temperatures as low as -18°C.
