   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An evergreen shrub or small tree reaching 2-7.5 m in
   height with the trunk up to 20 cm in diameter. It has thin, brown bark,
   10-14 cm long, pinnate leaves with 6-13 pairs of leaflets, yellow
   flowers and 5-18 cm long pods containing 10-20 seeds. USES It can be
   used as ground cover and revegetation of barred, erodible land and as
   green manure. The bark contains tanning used for heavy hides and sheep
   and goat skins. The bark fibre can be made into rope, and a fermented
   mixture of pounded bark and dissolved molasses can be made into an
   alcoholic beverage. Dry leaves are used to make tea. In times of
   scarcity the pods, leaves and flowers can be used as a vegetable. It
   can be used as fed for cattle and goats and for feeding silkworm, but
   poisonous substances have been reported. The roots, bark, flowers, seed
   and pods have medicinal properties. The tree can also be planted as an
   ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Harvesting may begins after 2-3
   years. COMMON NAMES Avaram, Matara tea, Tanner's cassia, Tarwar,
   Tarwad, Tarodo, Tangedu, Peikthingat, Gelam tangedu, Peikth-ingat.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: C. densistipulata. Avaran is native of
   India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. In East Africa, it can be found at
   altitudes from 150 to 600 m. The yield of sun-dried bark may average
   1500 kg/ha in a plantation with about 9000 plants/ha.
