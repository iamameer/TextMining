   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A vine or woody climber up to 10 m long. Under the
   best cultivation the mature vine has a bushy columnar appearance, 4 m
   high and 1.5 m in diameter. The root system may be as deep as 4 m or
   more. Leaves simple, glabrous, ovate, 8-20 x 4-12 cm. Fruits globose
   drupes, 4-6 mm in diameter, red when mature. USES Black pepper is
   produced from the dried fruit and white pepper is made from fruits that
   have been soaked and the mesocarp removed. Pepper is used as a spice
   and as a stimulative on the digestive organs. An essential oil is
   distilled from the fruit and used in perfumery. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Begins to bear in 3-4 years, reach full production after 7
   years and with an economical life of about 12-20 years. The periode
   from flowering to harvest is about 180-240 days. COMMON NAMES Black

   FURTHER INF Pepper is native of the Western Ghats in India. In India
   pepper can be grown up to 2000 m in elevation, but best results are
   obtained at altitudes below 500 m. It can be cultivated successfully at
   latitudes between 20°S and 20°N, but most production takes place close
   to the Equator. It require a hot and humid climate and thrives with a
   relative humidity between 65-95%. Level ground is most suitable for the
   production of pepper, provided there is no flooding, but it is often
   grown in rolling country or on hill slopes of varying stepness. Optimum
   yields at low capital input are 6 t/ha unprocessed (green) pepper, or 2
   t/ha sundried (black) pepper, or 1.67 t/ha washed and dried (white)
   pepper. In gardens with higher inputs yields may be 8-9 t/ha of green
   peper in the first harvest and 12-20 t/ha in the sixth or seventh
   harvest. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
