   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial grass. COMMON NAMES: Europaen beachgrass,
   Marram grass. FURTHER INF: Europaen beachgrass can be found along the
   coasts of the British Islands and coasts of Europe, excluding arctic
   and subarctic regions. A separate subspecies (subsp. breviligulata) is
   found in North America. It is the prime colonist of unstable and mobile
   sand hills in dune systems, dominating the 'white dune' stage. It is
   commonly a component of other plant communities at tops of beaches and
   on very sandy coastal ground. The tussocks have the ability to grow
   back through covering sand after being buried and can withstand sand
   accretion rates of up to 1 metre per year. The tussocks trap wind-blown
   sand and the root and rhizome growth stabilises the mobile dunes. It is
   drought tolerant, able to grow well above the water table, and tolerant
   too of the substantial temperature fluctuations on open sand surfaces.
   It is widely planted to repair or stabilise dune areas, though it can
   become a problem where introduced outside its native range.
