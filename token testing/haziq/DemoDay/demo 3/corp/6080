   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall deciduous tree reaching 30-40 m in height and
   up to 1 m in trunk diameter. On good sites it develops a tall clean
   cylindrical bole. USES The wood works well and has excellent bending
   qualities. It is a good furniture and cabinet timber, also used for
   panelling, parquetry and veneers. It is water-resistant and is used in
   shipbuilding. It also provides a good fuel. Creosote, which is a wood
   preservative and has medicinal properties, is obtained from the wood.
   Wood charcoal is used as an absorbent in alkali and phosphorus
   poisoning. Nuts are fed to livestock and poultry and yields an edible
   nondrying oil used for culinary purposes or in the manufacture of soaps
   and for lighting. The plant are often grown as ornamentals and as
   hedges. KILLING T Winter dormant the tree may tolerate -28°C. The
   flowers are killed at -1 to -3°C. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Juvenile
   growth habit persists for 30-40 years, in closed stands often 40-50
   years, and in extreme cases up to 60 years, before flowering begins.
   Good seed years occur every 3-4 years. Rotation period 110-120 years.
   COMMON NAMES European beech. FURTHER INF European beech can in Europe
   be found at elevations from sea level up to 1700 m in the Alps, a
   little higher in the Pyrenees, and up to 450 m in the Pennines. Maximum
   altitude corresponds to a midsummer isotherm of about 13°C. Young trees
   are shade tolerant.
