   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An erect, hirsute herb ranging from less than 1 m to more
   than 3.5 m in height, with a large flower head 10-30 cm in diameter. It
   has a strong taproot reaching a length of up to 3 m. USES: The seeds
   can be eaten fresh, roasted, or cooked and they can be extracted for
   oil. The oil is used for cooking, in the salad oil industry and for
   lighting. The expressed oil cake can be fed to livestock. Seeds have
   also been roasted and used as a substitute for coffee. Plant leaves are
   used as fodder and they have been used as a substitute for tobacco and
   for the manufacture of writing paper. A fiber is obtained from the
   stem. The flowers yield a yellow dye. Parts of the plant have medicinal
   properties. KILLING T.: Subtropical varieties can stand -6 to -10°C at
   two-leaf stage but the plant is sensitive to frost at all other stages
   of growth. GROWING PERIOD: Annual herb, can be harvested from 90-160
   days or from 70-200 days. COMMON NAMES: sunflower, tournesol, soleil,
   girasol, mirasol, sonnenblume. FURTHER INF.: Sunflower is thought to be
   indigenous to the western United States and the central highlands of
   Mexico. Sunflowers can be grown between 40°S and 55°N, but greatest
   production is between latitudes 20-50°N and 20-40°S and it can be grown
   at elevations up to 2600 m in the tropics, but best below 1500 m. It is
   generally shallow-rooted, though the giant types can reach as deep as
   2.5 m. It can reach a height of 0.5 m to 3 or even 5 m depending on
   cultivar and cultural conditions. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. The
   crop prefers low to moderate humidity, and excessive rain during early
   and late crop stages encourages diseases. Many sunflower varieties are
   open-pollinated with bees usually being the main agents, and to ensure
   high seed set there must be a high insect population. The average yield
   of sunflower seed in the world is around 1.4 t/ha, in Africa it is
   about 0.9 t/ha. Yields of 2-5 t/ha can be obtained.
