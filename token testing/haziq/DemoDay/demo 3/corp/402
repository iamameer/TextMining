   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb reaching 75-125 cm in height, with a short and
   thick stem, rosette leaves, and a terminal in florescence and fruit.
   The fruit is a multiple fruit formed by the almost complete fusion of
   100-200 berry-like fruitlets. It may weigh between 0.5 and 2.5 kg. USES
   The fruit contain about 14% sugar, vitamins A, B, and C, and bromelin,
   it is eaten fresh or canned as dessert, cooked in dishes, and used for
   juice. Sugar-syrup is obtained from the mill juice. It is a good source
   of alcohol and citric acid. The leaves yield a strong, silky fiber.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. KILLING T Damaged or killed
   at 5째C for prologed time, 0째C for a short time. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial, requireing 11-36 months to fruiting. The period from
   flowering to fruit ripening is 180-210 days, and the growth cycle is
   330-365 days. Economical life usually 2-3 years, though the plant may
   continue to live and fruit for over 50 years. COMMON NAMES Pinapple,
   Ananas, Nenas, O abacaxi. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: A. sativus,
   Bromelia comosa. Pinapple originated in tropical America. The
   cultivation is largely limited to latitudes between 25째S and N, but it
   can be found to 33째S. In Kenya it is grown between 1400-1800 m in
   elevation, at lower altitudes the fruit is to sweet. In Hawaii it can
   be grown between sea level and 600 m, and in the Philippines between
   500-800 m. Fruit tends to be smaller and less sweet at higher altitudes
   and most pinapple are grown near the sea in areas with a high
   atmospheric humidity often on hill slopes. It requires a high relative
   humidity. In subtropical regions it can only be grown in frost-free
   areas. The optimum yield is 60-80 t/ha for the first harvest, first
   ratoon crop yields approximately 10% less, the second ratoon crop 30%
   less.
