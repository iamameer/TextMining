   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small upright evergreen tree or shrub growing to a
   height of 5-17 m. Leaves are dark, glossy green, 20-30 cm long, and
   leathery in texture. Berries are comparatively large, turning dull red
   or light yellow. USES The beans have a bitter flavore and poor
   liquoring quality and are used as fillers in other coffee. Mentioned as
   a useful agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Begin to bear
   after 4-5 years. It may tolerate 21-30 days of mild drought. COMMON
   NAMES Liberica coffee, Kafeng barako, Excelsa. FURTHER INF Liberica
   coffee is indigenous to Liberia and Zaire. It can be found in tropical
   lowland forests and is recommended for altitudes between 450-600 m. It
   is a larger and more hardy tree than the other coffea species. With to
   much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers
   and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform
   flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It
   will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Yields of 670-900
   kg/ha have been reported from Malaysia.
