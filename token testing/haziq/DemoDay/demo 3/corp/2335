   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, glabrous herb with a slender stem and ovate
   oblong leaves 10-15 x 3-10 cm reaching up to 1-1.5 m in height, and
   with a shallow root system and rhizomes penetrating more deeply in the
   soil. USES It provides starch used in jellies and pastes and is often
   part of infant or invalid food because it is highly digestible. The
   starch is also used as a base for face powders and in certain types of
   glue. It counteracts insect stings and also has several medicinal uses.
   A fibrous debris from the rhizomes is fed to cattle. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Flowers about 90 days after planting and the rhizomes are
   mature after 300-365 days. Successive crops are usually grown on the
   same land for 5-6 years. COMMON NAMES Arrowroot, West Indian arrowroot,
   Arruruz, Cara maco, Sagu, Yuquilla. FURTHER INF Arrowroot is native of
   South America. It produces better crops in the lowlands, but can be
   grown at altitudes of up to 1000 m. Yields may within 5-6 years be
   between 10-35 t/ha of rhizomes, from which 2.5-7.5 t/ha of starch can
   be obtained. Friable soils are preferred for better tuber development
   and easy harvesting. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
