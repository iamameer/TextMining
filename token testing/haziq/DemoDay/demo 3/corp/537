   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A trailing grass growing 30-150 cm tall with heavy
   lanceolate leaf-blades 8-10 mm wide. The erect stems arise from a long
   stoloniferous base and root down from lower nodes producing a dense
   sward. Flowers have 2-5 racemes, 2-5 cm long with a broad ciliate
   rachis and 4 mm long spikelets. USES: Used for pasture and hay. It is a
   valuable grass for erosion control as it covers the ground well, it
   withstands heavy grazing and establishes on poor and rocky soils. It is
   important because of its high productivity under intensive use, and its
   tolerance of low fertility and relative freedom from pests and
   diseases. KILLING T.: 0^oC. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial grass, growing
   from spring to late autumn. Within 90 days a complete ground cover
   should be obtained. COMMON NAMES: (English) Surinam grass, signal
   grass, Kenya sheep grass, sheep grass, (Spanish) pasto alambre, pasto
   braquiaria, pasto chontalpo, pasto de la palizade, pasto de las
   orillas, pasto peludo, pasto prodigio, zacate prodigio, (Portugese)
   australiano braquiaria, braquiaria comum, braquiaria de alho, capim
   brachiaria decumbens, (Malay) rumput signal, (Thai) ya-siknaentonnon,
   ya-surinam. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: B. eminii, B. bequaertii.
   Suriname grass is native of tropical East Africa. It can be found
   between latitudes 27^oN and S at elevations from sea level to 1800 m.
   It has good drought tolerance and is adapted to a dry season of four or
   five months. However, it prefers 1,500 mm or more of rain. It does not
   do well where the dry season is more than five months. Within three
   months a complete ground cover can be obtained. It has a long growing
   season with productive active growth from spring to late autumn. It is
   very aggressive and there have been difficulties in forming long-term,
   stable associations with legumes. It may become a weed but can easily
   be ploughed out. It needs to be stocked heavily. Added nitrogen is
   required to keep it in active leafy growth. Frequent applications of
   nitrogen-up to six times per season-keep the grass in a very nutritious
   condition and improve live weight gain especially under high rainfall
   conditions. Dry matter yields may vary between 4-36 t/ha.
