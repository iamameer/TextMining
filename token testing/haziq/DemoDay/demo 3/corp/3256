   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A leafy tussock grass with unbranched culms to 30-50 or
   even 200 cm, short sturdy rhizomes, and long, narrow basal leaves. Leaf
   blades green to blue-green, flat, linear, 10-15 cm long and 3-5 mm
   wide, tapering to a soft point. USES: For warm season light grazing. It
   is extremely palatable and during heavy grazing tillers may be pulled
   from the ground. Also providing useful standover feed into the cool
   season. Sown in rows on sandy red soils as a pasture/crop rotation.
   Makes high quality hay. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing in the
   summer. COMMON NAMES: Wool grass. FURTHER INF: It is widely distributed
   in Africa from 17ºN in the Sudan and Eritrea to 29ºS in South Africa,
   and to 2100 m in Namibia. It is a climax species, found in semi-arid
   and arid grassland and savannah, often on hillsides. Occurs in areas
   with rainfall from 175-950 mm, but most common between 350-500 mm and
   with average annuial temperatures between 16-28ºC, with heavy frosts at
   the lower end of the range. It is extremely drought tolerant, but
   intolerant of waterlogging and flooding. Common on sandy or gravelly
   soils, sometimes loams, with pH from 5.5-7.5. Grows on infertile soils
   and is more tolerant of low phosphorus levels than many other grasses.
   Fire has little adverse effect on regrowth. Yields may vary between
   1.3-4 t/ha.
