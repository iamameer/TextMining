   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a vigorous bunchgrass. Plants are strongly
   caespitose. Leaves are fine, dense, and mostly basal, with sheaths
   remaining firm and entire. Culms are densely tufted in large bunches,
   with tuft 15-25 cm high, usually more than 1/2 the length of culms.
   Culms are erect, from 0.3-1 m tall. Plants have a strong root system
   that can extend 40 cm deep in a 10 cm diameter plant. USE: It provides
   important forge for many types of domestic livestock and several
   wildlife species. It is slow to establish, but once established, has
   abundant growth of fine leaves that provide effective ground cover, and
   high yields of tough, fine, fibrous roots that control erosion and
   improve soil structure. GROWING PERIOD: Long-lived, cool-season
   perennial. COMMON NAMES Idaho fescue. FURTHER INF: Idaho fescue grows
   on many landforms, elevations, aspects, and soil types. It occurs at
   elevations from 300 m in Oregon to nearly 4000 m in Colorado. It occurs
   in a variety of ecosystems (grassland, sagebrush, forest, and alpine).
   In the grasslands of the intermountain region, it occurs in valleys,
   canyons, benches, slopes, and rolling hills bordering
   sagebrush/grasslands, juniper woodlands, or the lower treeline. It is
   most commonly found in mesic grasslands, but is also a component of the
   more xeric grasslands dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass, where it
   usually occupies the cooler, moister microsites on north and east
   aspects.
