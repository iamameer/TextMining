   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A variable, erect, herbaceous, indeterminate plant
   reching 1-3 m in height. It has hairy leaves and tubular flowers, white
   or pink with purplish-red spots. The capsules are erect, 5 cm long and
   awl-shaped and the seeds are about 3-4 mm long, 2 mm broad and 1 mm
   thick. USES The seeds are edible, they can be fried and eaten in soups,
   mixed with sugar as a sweet, or used in or on bread, cakes and pastry.
   The seeds are extracted for an oil used in margarines, soaps, paints,
   salad dressings, cooking oils, as an aromatic lamp oil, as a carrier
   for pharmaceuticals and perfume, and as a synergist for pyrethin
   insecticide sprays. The expressed seed cakes can be fed to livestock
   and are sometimes also used for human consumption. Young leaves are
   used as a soup vegetable. Various parts of the plant have medicinal
   porperties. The stems are burnt as fuel. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Annual, maturing in 40-180 days.
   Most cultivars mature in 80-100 days, while some require 100-180 days.
   COMMON NAMES Sesame seed, Sesamo, Sesam, Sesame, Sesamier, Simsim,
   Benniseed, Benue oil seed, Bebefin, Bene, Ridi, Beme, Poeuloel,
   Molekelele, Ufuta, Yanmoti, Gingelly, Til. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: S. orientale, S. alatum, S capense, S. sabulosum. Sesame's
   main distribution is between 25째S and 25째N, but it can be found up to
   40째N and 35째S. In East Africa, sesame is normally grown at elevations
   between sea level and 1500 m, but it can be found up to 1800 m and in
   the Himalays up to 2000 m. The species is probably indigenous to
   Ethiopia. Sesame is susceptible to wind damage after the main stem has
   elongated and high relative humidity or heavy rains may increase the
   incidense of fungal diseases. The average yield of sesame seed in the
   world is about 350 kg/ha but yields can be up to 3.0 t/ha.
