   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree that may reach up to about 45 m in
   nature, with a long clean and cylindrical trunk. The crown is slender
   with a light or crowded branching system. The bark is thin, rather
   smooth and greyish-brown to dark brown in colour. USE: The ripe fruit
   is edible but very resinous. The timber is used as building timber and
   for furniture, panelling, shelving, drawer linings, shop counters and
   light duty impregnated railway sleepers. It is also a good fuel. The
   bark contains 3-6% tannin. Leaves contain podolide, is a main
   ingredient for insecticide. Oil extracted from the seeds or fruits are
   used to treat gonorrhoea. The sap is used as a remedy for chest
   complaints. The tree is planted for shade, shelter, windbreak,
   re-forestation and as an ornamental and street tree. Many bird species
   nest in the tree. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: East African
   yellow wood, oteninqua yellow wood, podo. FURTHER INF: The tree can be
   found in coastal swamp forest, transitional rainforest and dry
   evergreen forest. Frequent seen as a single tree in grassland or
   farmland in areas with sufficient rainfall. It seems sometimes to be
   cultivated. A humid and warm climate is preferable; in dry and hot
   areas plantations fail. It can tolerate moderate frost but not drought.
