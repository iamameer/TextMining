   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Fast growing, glabrous, deciduous, tree to ca 25 m tall,
   branches drooping; trunk diameter to 60 cm; bark smooth, gray. Leaves
   imparipinnate, shiny; young leaves pinkish red, mature leaves glossy,
   deep green; leaflets 5-9, the terminal leaflet larger than the others;
   stipels none; stipules caducous. Flowers fragrant, white to pinkish,
   paired along rachis in axillary, pendent, long racemes or panicles;
   calyx campanulate or cup-shaped, truncate, short-dentate, lowermost
   lobe sometimes longer; standard suborbicular, broad, usually with 2
   inflexed, basal ears, thinly silky-haired outside; wings oblique, long,
   somewhat adherent to the obtuse keel; keel petals coherent at apex;
   stamens monadelphous, vexillary stamen free at the base but joined with
   others into a closed tube; ovary subsessile to short-stalked,
   pubescent; ovules 2, rarely 3; style filiform, upper half incurved,
   glabrous; stigma small, terminal. Pod short stalked, oblique-oblong,
   flat, smooth, thickly leathery to sub-woody, indehiscent, 1-seeded;
   seed thick, reniform. USES: As an ornamental in gardens and along
   avenues and roadsides, for its fragrant Wisteria-like flowers, and as a
   host plant for lac insects. Flowers are considered a good source of
   pollen for honeybees in India and they yield adequate nectar. With a
   calorific value of 4 600 kcal/kg, pongam is commonly used as a fuel
   wood. A preferred species for controlled soil erosion and binding sand
   dunes because of its extensive network of lateral roots. Incorporation
   of leaves and the press cake into soils improves fertility. The seeds
   contain pongam oil, a bitter, red brown, thick, non-drying, nonedible
   oil, 27-36% by weight, which is used for tanning leather, soap, as a
   liniment to treat scabies, herpes, and rheumatism and as an
   illuminating oil. The seed oil is under investigation as a renewable
   source of bio-diesel. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: It is
   native to humid and sub-tropic environments and is common along
   waterways or seashores, with its roots in fresh or saltwater. It is
   reported as native to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand
   and exotic in Australia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan,
   Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,
   Philippines, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
   Tonga and the United States of America. It occurs naturally in lowland
   forest on limestone and rocky coral outcrops on the coast, along the
   edges of mangrove forest and along tidal streams and rivers. It can be
   found at elevations between sea level and 1200 m. In its natural
   habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees
   withstand light frost and temperatures of up to 50°C. Reported
   temperature range for growth is 10-50°C with the optimum between
   16-38°C. It is drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic
   conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. Reported
   annual rainfall range for growth is 400-2500 mm with the optimum
   between 500-2000 mm. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of
   2-6 months. It is a shade bearer and can grow under the shade of other
   trees, it is, however, not a shade demander and grows well even with
   full overhead light. It is well adapted to adverse soil moisture
   conditions and waterlogging. It can grow on most soil types but best
   growth is found on deep well-drained sandy loams with assured moisture,
   it will however also grow on sandy soils and heavy swelling clay soils.
   It does not do well on dry sands. It is very tolerant of saline
   conditions and alkalinity. Reported soil pH range for growth is 6-9
   with the optimum between 6.5-8.5. Nodulation is reported on pongam. In
   nurseries and fields the presence of nodules on un-inoculated pongam
   seedlings is common. Therefore, this species may not be specific in its
   Rhizobium strain requirement. It nodulates and fixes atmospheric
   nitrogen with Rhizobium of the cowpea group.
   Propagation methods: Natural reproduction is profuse by seed and common
   by root suckers. Spontaneous seedlings and root suckers are produced
   and may cause serious weed problems. Direct sowing is common and most
   successful. Seeds require no pre-treatment and germinate within 7 days
   to 1 month of sowing. Germination is hypogeal and the radicle develops
   quickly before the plumule emerges. In the nursery, it can be planted
   at a close spacing, as young plants tolerate shade well; in India a
   spacing of 7.5 x 15 cm is recommended. Seedlings attain a height of
   25-30 cm in their first growing season. Transplanting to the field
   should occur at the beginning of the next rainy season when seedlings
   are about 60 cm in height. Seedlings have large root systems and soil
   should be retained around the roots during transplanting. Easily
   established by direct seeding or by planting nursery-raised seedlings
   or stump cuttings of 1-2 cm root-collar diameter. Propagation by branch
   cuttings and root suckers is also possible.
   Tree Management: Seedling survival and growth benefit from annual weed
   control for the first 3 years after transplanting. Growth of young
   trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in
   diameter in 13 months was recorded in India. Trees coppice well and can
   also be pollarded. When planted as a shade or ornamental tree, pruning
   may be necessary to obtain a trunk of appropriate height. The spacing
   adopted in avenue planting is about 8 m between plants. In block
   plantings, the spacing can range from 2 x 2 m to 5 x 5 m. Individual
   trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually, (8-24 kg of seeds). The lateral
   spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than
   most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely.
   Because of these characteristics, pongam is usually unsuitable for
   agro-forestry and has the potential to become a weed if not managed
   carefully; it also attracts many pests and diseases.
