   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, deciduous, spreading tree from 4-10 m high
   often trained to a vase shape. Leaves simple, fruits ovoid-ellipsoid,
   3-4 cm x 2-2.5 cm (larger in cultivated varieties), splitting at
   maturity, stone 2.5-3 cm x 1.5-2 cm, pitted, seed ovoid, compressed and
   about 1.5-2 cm x 1-1.5 cm. USES It produces edible kernels used mainly
   in candies, baked goods, and confectionery. The kernels are procesed
   into almond powder, marzipan powder, paste powder, and almond drink
   powder. Roasted kernels are a popular snack food. An oil is obtained
   from the kernels and used in cosmetic creams and lotions. Almond butter
   is processed like peanut butter. Shells are burned to produce
   electricity and are used as roughage in cattle fed. The trees also
   yield a gum. KILLING T Flowers are damaged at -2 to -3°C or -4°C for 30
   minutes and fruits are damaged at -1°C. GROWING PERIOD Perennial
   deciduous tree, that begin to bear after 3-4 years and with an
   economical life of about 20 years. COMMON NAMES Almond, Amand, Almenda,
   Mandel. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: P. dulcis, Amygdalus communis.
   Almond are probably a native of southeastern Asia. It can be grown at
   altitudes from sea level to 460 m in subtropical areas. It need 90-450
   hours of winter chilling but a frost free spring. It require low to
   medium humidity. The introduction of 2-6 beehives per ha to almond
   orchards at flowering will increase fruit set and final yield. Almonds
   do not set fruit with there own pollen, so at least two cultivars must
   be planted together for cross-pollination.
