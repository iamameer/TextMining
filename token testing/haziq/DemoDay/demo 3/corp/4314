   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION Deciduous tree or shrub with simple leaves, erect
   catkins. Fruit 1-3 nuts, brown, coriaceous, in a swollen, spiny cupule
   which dehisces irregularly by 2-3 valves. Chinese chestnuts are smaller
   and less sweet than the American chestnut but sweeter than the European
   chestnut. USES The nuts are eaten raw, roasted, boiled or dried, or
   ground and prepared into soup, chocolates, pastries, etc. The
   straight-grained, heavy timber is durable and used for fencing,
   furniture, ship masts, poles, mine props, railway sleepers, etc. Bark
   and wood extracts used for tanning leather. Leaves are often fed to
   silkworms. KILLING T Flowers will not tolerate frost but the tree may
   withstand -29Â°C when fully dormant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial, require
   5-6 years to first bearing. Flowers in June and fruits mature in about
   150 days. COMMON NAMES Chinese chestnut. FURTHER INF
   Chinese chestnut is native of northern China. It can be found at
   altitude up to 2500 m. It is adapted to low to medium humidity in
   summer, and medium to high humidity in winter. The trees apparently
   have a short cold requirement for breaking dormancy in the spring but
   require an environment free of late spring frosts. Trees are expected
   to yield about 3000 kg/ha, with optimal yields as high as 4400 kg/ha.
