   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen or deciduous tree usually 10-15 m
   occasionally up to 18 m high, attaining a girth of up to 2 m. The trunk
   is large, buttressed and angled towards the base. Roots shallow.
   Flowers orange-red, almost scarlet and slightly fragrant. USE: Flowers
   are reputed to produce bee forage. The large pods as well as the wood
   are used for fuel. The bark yields gum and has medicinal properties. It
   is planted as a shade tree and living fence in dairy farms, tea
   plantations and compounds and as an ornamental in gardens. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Flamboyant, Poinciana, Krishna chira.
   FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: Poinciana regia. It originates from
   Madagascar, where it is now almost extinct. It is now widespread in
   most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Trees can grow at
   higher altitudes than recommended, but flowering becomes erratic. The
   tree demands light and grows weakly and sparsely under shade. It grows
   in areas with both high and scanty rainfall. It has a superficial root
   system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and
   flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should
   therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are
   deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced. It can be
   found at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. The range of natural
   occurrence is 12-15°S. The tree is fast growing and tolerant of salt
   winds. The tree seems to tolerate many types of soils from clay to
   sandy, but it prefers sandy soils.
