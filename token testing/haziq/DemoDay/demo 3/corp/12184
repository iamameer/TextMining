   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small to moderate-sized, much-branched deciduous
   tree with smooth, dark green, scaly bark. It resembles the acacias but
   lacks thorns. Its root system is shallow and spreading. USE: The leaves
   are used as tea and also make excellent fodder. The wood is used for
   furniture making, agricultural implements and construction and as
   fuelwood and charcoal. Tannin can be obtained from the bark. The seeds
   are said to be poisonous. Gum and fruits have medicinal properties. Its
   spreading root system makes it a good soil binder, deterring soil
   erosion. It is used as shade tree for tea and coffee plantations and
   for re-vegetation of degraded hilly areas in dry and semi-arid tracts.
   Planted as an ornamental and street tree. Mentioned as a agroforestry
   species and in India, Indonesia and other countries, it is usually
   incorporated into smallholding, rainfed agriculture and diversified
   with maize, cassava and fruit trees such as papaya, mango and orange.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: arad (Arabic), bitter albizia
   (English). FURTHER INF: The tree demands strong sunlight and is
   intolerant of shade, very hardy and shows marked resistance to drought.
   It has a wide distribution in Africa, occurring from Sudan and Ethiopia
   southwards to Zimbabwe, Botswana and the Transvaal, growing mainly in
   sandy woodlands. In India, it is one of the characteristic trees of the
   dry regions of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The scrub
   forests in which it is usually found often have thorny species,
   particularly acacias. It thrives in light soils but tolerates clays and
   is often found near streams, where it can reach more water.
