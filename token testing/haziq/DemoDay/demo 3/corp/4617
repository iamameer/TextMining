   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small straight, columnar, slightly spiny evergreen
   shrub or treelet reaching 2-7.5 m in height, with a slender stem and
   upright branches. It has a long taproot, elliptic to obovate leaves,
   3-8 x 1-4 cm, and the fruit is a subglobose to globose berry, up to 4.5
   cm in diameter with a greenish-yellow to orange-red colour. USES The
   acid fruit juice is processed into bottled concentrate and juice. It is
   also used as a stain remover, body deodorant, skin bleach, hair shampoo
   and as a skin treatment. The fruit is used for marmelade and chutneys,
   preserved whole in sugar syrup, and used as flavouring in seafood and
   meat dishes. The flowers are a source of honey. It may serve as a
   rootstock for lemons and the oval kumquat. It is planted as an
   ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Cloned trees come into bearing 3
   years after planting, seedlings after 5-6 years. Fruit mature about 5
   months from flowering. COMMON NAMES Calamondin, China orange, Golden
   lime, Jeruk peres, Jeruk kasturi, Jeruk potong, Limau kesturi, Limau
   chuit, Kalamondin, Kalamansi, Limonsito, Sommapit, Somchit, Manao-wan,
   Tac hanh. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: x C. mitis, Citrus
   microcarpa, C. mitis. Calamondin almost certainly originated in China
   as a natural hybrid between a sour, loose-skinned mandarin, probably
   Citrus reticulata var. austera and a kumquat, perhaps Fortunella
   margarita. It thrives in areas with an evenly distributed rainfall, or
   irrigation and is usually grown in the lowlands. It is not resistant to
   strong winds. At 6 years the tree may yield 10 kg fruit and at 10 years
   it may yield 50 kg. An orchard with 625 trees/ha, with an average yield
   of about 30 kg/tree, will yield about 19 t/ha. (TEMP estimated by the
   compiler).
