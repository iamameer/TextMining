   somtimes forming a thick mat and reaching 30-75 cm in height. It has
   triofoliate leaves, bright yellow flowers and 6-13 cm long, slender
   pods with 10-16 seeds. The root system is extensive and deep. It has
   bright yellow flowers and narrow 6-12 cm long pods. USES Grown as a
   pulse crop and as a green vegetable. Mature seeds are eaten boiled,
   fried, or sprouted and the leaves and young pods are cooked as
   vegetable. The beans are a good source of protein, calcium, iron and
   vitamin B. Plant remains are used as animal feed. The plant can also be
   used for soil improvement, green manure, living hedge and as a soil
   cover crop. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing short-lived perennial, grown as
   an annual. The young seeds, pods and leaves it may be harvested 40-130
   days from sowing. For forage it may be harvested after 70-80 days, but
   yields are higher at 120-130 days. COMMON NAMES Rice bean, Japanese

   V. calcarata, Phaseolus pubescens, P. calcaratus, Azukia umbellata. The
   rice bean is found growing wild in India, central China and Malaysia.
   It is suited to humid tropical lowlands at elevations up to 2000 m. A
   daylength of less than 12 hours is required for flower initiation and
   seed production, when grown under long day conditions the crop produces
   masses of vegetation but little or no seed. The plant is adapted to
   high humidity. Average yield of green forage is about 2.2-3.5 t/ha but
   yields of up to 33 t/ha have been reported, while yields of dried beans
   may average 200-800 kg/ha and yields up to 2.2 t/ha have been reported.
