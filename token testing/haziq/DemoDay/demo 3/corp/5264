   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an aggressively creeping, stoloniferous legume that
   may reach 1 m height in dense stands. Stems are multi-branched but
   quite woody at their base. Young plants always have single broadly
   elliptical leaves; on more mature plants leaves may be unifoliate or
   trifoliate. Flowers purple to dark pink flowers, turning bluish with
   age. Pods 3 mm long, covered in dense hairs. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial
   growing spring to autumn. USE: Used as a cover crop for erosion and
   weed control in tree plantations, with potential use as a green manure.
   Incorporated in grass/legume pastures. Possible use in agro-forestry
   due to its shade tolerance and comparatively shallow rooting. Can be
   used for cut-and-carry and restoration of degraded soils. COMMON NAMES:
   Desmodio (Spanish); Khonthi din (Thailand); Trang qu'a xoan (Vietnam).
   FURTHER INF: It is native to: tropical southeast Asia. Generally found
   in humid and moist sub-humid lowlands with 1200-4500 mm rainfall,
   preferably more than 2000 mm and weak dry season of no more than 3-4
   months. Good tolerance of waterlogging and periodic flooding. Adapted
   to low fertility, acid soils (pH 4-7), with high Al and Mn, and low P.
   Good tolerance to grazing or cutting. Dry matter production may be
   18-23 t/ha.
