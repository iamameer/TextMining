   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A small to medium-sized dioecious, deciduous tree reaching
   12-21 m in height with a round-topped crown. In forest stands the stem
   may be straight, tall, and slender. USE: The seeds and fruits of common
   persimmon are generally low in crude protein, crude fat, and calcim,
   but high in nitrogen-free extract and tannin. The wood is hard, smooth,
   and even textured. It is used for turnery, plane stocks, veneer, golf
   club heads, and occasionally low-grade lumber. It sends down a deep
   taproot which makes it a good species for erosion control. The unripe
   fruit and inner bark are sometimes used in the treatment of fever,
   diarrhea, and hemorrhage. Ink can also be made from the fruit. The tree
   is sometimes planted as an ornamental. The flowers are used in the
   production of honey GROWING PERIOD: Perennial tree. COMMON NAMES
   Persimmon, Common persimmon, American persimmon. FURTHER INF: Persimmon
   originated in southern and central United States. It grows on a wide
   variety of sites but grows best on terraces of large streams and river
   bottoms. It grows best on alluvial soils such as clays and heavy loams.
   In the Mississippi Delta, usual sites are wet flats, shallow sloughs,
   and swamp margins. In the Midwest it grows on poorly drained upland
   sites, but growth there is very slow.
