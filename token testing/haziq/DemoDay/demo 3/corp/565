   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching up to 9 m in height and 9
   m in width. It is in flower from August to September, and the seeds
   ripen from September to November. The flowers are dioecious. The fruit
   comprises a ball about 1.5 cm in diameter with numerous small edible
   fruits protruding - there is not much edible flesh but it has a good
   flavour. USE: The fruit can be consumed raw but prolonged ingestion is
   said to weaken the bones. The leaf juice is diaphoretic and laxative -
   it is also used in the treatment of dysentery. It is also poulticed
   onto various skin disorders, bites etc. The stem bark is haemostatic.
   The fruit is diuretic, ophthalmic, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. The
   root is cooked with other foods as a galactogogue. A fibre from the
   bark is used in making paper, cloth and rope. A leather substitute can
   also be made from the bark. When used for making paper branches are
   harvested after the leaves have fallen in the autumn, they are steamed
   and the fibres stripped off. The paper varies in colour if the outer
   and inner barks are used together or separately. The wood is coarse
   grained, soft, easily worked, light, not very durable. Used for cups,
   bowls etc. The tree is also grown as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Paper Mulberry. FURTHER INF: It is native of
   East Asia and China and is occasionally naturalized in South East
   Europe. Its natural habitat is thickets, mountain ravines, woodland,
   sunny edges and forests. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution
