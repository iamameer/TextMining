   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Tap-rooted, trailing leguminous herb with slender stems,
   rooting at the nodes in some genotypes. Leaves trifoliolate.
   Inflorescence an axillary raceme with up to 30 flowers inserted in
   pairs along rachis, flowers papilionate, petals showy and
   cream-coloured with purple centre, 3-6 cm in diameter. Pod linear,
   compressed, up to 30 cm long, 1 cm wide. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   Cutting intervals will depend on soil moisture and fertility; 70-100
   days is suggested as an adequate interval with a cutting height of
   10-15 cm. Warm season growth only. USE: Grazed pastures in mixture with
   grasses, as legume -only protein banks, cut-and-carry, and soil cover
   in orchards and plantations. COMMON NAMES: Centrosema. FURTHER INF:
   Synonym: C. lisboae. The grass is native to tropical America and occurs
   naturally between latitudes 22°N and 18°S. Humid to sub-humid climate
   with annual rainfall >1,000 mm, 3-6 dry months. Once established, it is
   very drought tolerant. Flowering is induced by shortening daylength and
   the grass is very photoperiod-sensitive. It may withstand 3-4 dry
   months and remain green. Adapted to low- to medium-fertility, well
   drained soils of various textures, particularly loams. Tolerates very
   acid conditions, with high soluble Al and Mn. Dry matter yields may be
   5-25 t/ha.
