   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A large deciduous but nearly evergreen tree, usually
   30-40 m high with a girth of 3-4 m, but the tree can reach 60 m and a
   girth of 9 m. The bole is straight and cylindrical and up to 1/2 to 2/3
   of the tree height, often with high buttresses. USES The timber has a
   reddish tint and a high quality, it is used for carpentry, veneers,
   plywood, cabinet making, light construction and boat building. It is
   used as shade for cacao and coffee. An oil can be extracted from the
   seed kernels and the bark is used for dying and tanning leather. It has
   various medicinal properties. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry
   species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. In India, the leaves appear in
   March, flowers appear in April-May, and the fruit ripen nearly a year
   later, in February-March. Leaves fall in February-March. On good sites
   and under intensive management the tree may reach a merchantable size
   at 30-50 years of age. It withstands a dry season of up to 7 months.
   COMMON NAMES Large-leaved mahogany, Big-leaved mahogany, Broad-leaved
   mahogany, Mahogany, Acajou, Caoba, Bastard mahogany, Honduras mahogany,

   from Central America to northern Peru and Brazil, and to the Antilles.
   In its native range it can be found at elevations from sea level to
   1500 m, but it is best adapted to elevations below 600 m. The
   latitudinal range of natural occurrence is 23°N-18°S. Seedlings require
   shading to become established, and the tree can be used for erosion
   control as an undercrop for teak. It can adapt to a wide range of soil
   conditions and it is windfirm. Annual wood production potential is 7-18
   m3/ha.
