   Finer types suitable for hay. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Golden bristle grass. FURTHER INF: Native to Africa south of Sahara and
   commonly planted in Africa, Asia, and Australia, becoming naturalised
   beyond the planted areas. Found on a wide range of habitats from wet
   areas (e.g. riparian land, swamp margins) to rocky hillsides at
   elevations between 600-3300 m. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall
   above 650 mm and planted where rainfall exceeds 1000 mm. Grows best at
   about 18-22Â°C. Moderate shade tolerance, producing to 60-70% of full
   light yield at 50% light. Usually found on soils ranging from sand to
   clay loam and light clay with a pH between 5.5-6.5, but will grow on
   heavy clay and with a wider pH range. Survives low fertility conditions
   but responds to improved fertility. DM yields of 10-26 t/ha/year have
