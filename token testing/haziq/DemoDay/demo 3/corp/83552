   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree reaching 9-30 m in height. Bark usually
   occurs in channeled pieces, 4-10 mm, thick with a varying tinge of red
   in the grey-brown or brown outer and inner surfaces. The outer surface
   is longitudinally furrowed and bears numerous narrow, transverse cracks
   at fairly regular intervals of 1-2 cm. Leaves 24-47 x 10-17.5 cm
   glabrous, obovate, cuneate or rounded. USE: The wood is used as fuel
   and the bark contains tannin. Poisonous doses of the bark are reported
   to paralyze respiration and the drug can cause severe hypotension,
   abdominal distress and weakness. It can also be used as a fish poison.
   The bark contains up to 6% of a mixture of alkaloids, the principle one
   being yohimbine, which is also known as aphrodine. It is the source of
   the only clinically-proven cure for impotence and has long been used as
   a traditional stimulant in Africa. It is also used as a local
   anaesthetic, a mild stimulant to prevent drowsiness, a hallucinogen, a
   treatment for angina, a hypotensive and as a performance enhancer for
   athletes. The tree is used in agroforestry. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: yohimbe. FURTHER INF: It occurs mostly in the Atlantic
   Evergreen Forest with Caesalpiniaceae, an extensive forest formation
   extending from S.E. Nigeria to Congo. The species occurs mainly in
   closed canopy forest. Most common in coastal forest, although not
   widespread throughout its range.
