   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, branched, evergreen tree reaching 10-45 m
   in height, with a trunk diameter of 60-120 cm and a deep tap-root
   system. Fruit a fleshy drupe, very variable in shape, size and colour,
   usually ovoid-oblong, up to 30 cm x 10 cm and yellowish-green to
   reddish. USES The fruit is a good source of vitamin A, it is eaten
   fresh or made into juice, squash, jams, jellies, or preserves. Unripe
   fruits are used in pickles, chutneys, and culinary preparations. The
   seeds are used as food or ground for flour. Leaves can be used as
   cattle feed. Timber is used in many ways and valued for boat building.
   KILLING T A few hours of temperatures from -5 to 1°C may damage or kill
   bearing trees are damaged. Young trees and actively growing shoots are
   likely to be killed at -1°C. Flowers are not frost tolerant and fruits
   are liable to chilling injury at 4-10°C or 8-12°C, depending on the
   cultivar. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Seedlings may grow 3-7 years before
   first bearing and the tree may only produce one good crop every 3-4
   year. Yields increase up to the 20th year, decline after the 40th year
   and the tree may live for 100 years or more. The fruiting cycle is
   150-270 days and the time of development after fertilization to
   maturity of fruit is 60-150 days, depending on cultivar and
   temperature. COMMON NAMES Mango, Ghari am, Am, Ambo amri, Manguier,
   Mamuang, Mangga, Mempelam, Ampelam, Mavena, Mavu, Amba, Ambo, Amra,
   Maa, Mamadi, Paho, Tharyetthi, Svaay, Mwangx, Xoai. FURTHER INF Mango
   originates from the Indo-Burmese monsoon region. It thrives in both
   tropical and subtropical areas within the latitudinal range is 30°N to
   25°S. It can for non-commercial production be grown at elevations up to
   1200 m and up to 600 m for commercial production. It does best with
   strongly marked seasons in the tropical summer rainfall regions with
   dry weather and moderate humidity for flowering and fruiting. High
   humidity, mist and heavy dew promote fungal attack, while low humidity
   and drying wind can cause wilting and strong winds may destroy the
   crop. In areas with two wet seasons flowering and fruit production may
   occur twice each year, but normally only one crop per year is produced.
   Very fertile soils with adequate supplies of water thoughout the year
   may result in luxuriant vegetative growth and poor cropping. The trees
   are drought-tolerant and do not seem to suffer from occasional
   flooding. According to Purseglove even shallow and impervious soils
   produce mangoes, but for optimal conditions the watertable should be
   below 2-2.5 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. In the 10th year, a tree
   bears 400-600 fruits. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce
   10-30 t/ha of fruit year. Average yields are, however often quit low
   e.g. in the Philippines 6 t/ha, in Peninsular Malaysia 3.5 t/ha and in
   Thailand 2.3 t/ha.
