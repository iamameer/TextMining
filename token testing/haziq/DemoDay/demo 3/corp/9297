   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized, spiny, deciduous tree reaching a
   height of 15-30 m. The trunk is forking, slightly angled, often crooked
   with a diameter of up to 60 cm. The tree is shallow rooted and has a
   open irregular crown. The flower clusters are 10-20 cm long with many
   white, fragrant flowers. USES Wood used for fenceposts, mine timbers,
   flooring, furniture, vehicles, woodenware, railway crossties, boxes
   crates, skates, and firewood and charcoal. The tree is planted for
   shade, shelterbelts, wildlife cover, erosion control and as an
   ornamental. It is a source of honey. Leaves are used as fodder but may
   be toxic in quantity. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species.
   GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing, short-lived perennial tree. The growth is
   rapid the first 15-30 years and ceases almost entirely after 50 years.
   Withstands dry periods of 2-6 months. COMMON NAMES False acacia, Black
   locust, Robinie, Robinia, Locust tree, Yellow locust. FURTHER INF In
   the Himalayan, False acacia is found at elevations from 1200 to 3300 m,
   and in Europe, from sea level to 2500 m. The species is indigenous to
   the Appalachian and Ozark mountains of the southeast and central parts
   of the United States. The latitudinal range of natural occurrence is
   34-40Â°N. It is often found as a pioneer on old fields, burned areas,
   and lands strip-mined for coal. The tree is able to withstand air
   pollution and salt winds, but it suffers from wind damage, ice and snow
   break, and it is intolerant of shade. It is drought hardy, it fixes
   nitrogen and it can regenerate rapidly. Annual wood production
   potential is 4-20 m3/ha. It has been reported that humans, horses,
   cattle, sheep, and poultry may be poisoned by eating leaves, roots,
   bark, sprouts, seed pods, and trimmings.
