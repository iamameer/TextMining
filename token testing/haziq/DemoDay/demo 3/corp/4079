   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a shrub or small tree reaching 2.5-6 m in height,
   stem usually simple, rarely branched, woody at base and covered with a
   fissured, corky bark. All parts of the plant exude a white latex when
   cut or broken. USE: Young pods, senescing leaves and flowers can be
   used as fed. Stems produce a good charcoal. The stem produces durable
   fibre used for various purposes. The very light wood can also be used
   for floats for fishing nets. Latex, rubber, tannin and dye can be
   obtained from the tree. The bark and the latex are widely used as arrow
   and spear poisons. Bark, wood, root bark and the sap have medicinal
   properties. A source of green manure. The plant can help improve soil
   water conditions and also acts as a soil binder. A suitable indicator
   of exhausted soil. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: calotropis,
   Dead Sea fruit, desert wick, giant milkweed, rubber bush, sodom apple,
   swallow-wort (English). FURTHER INF: It is drought-resistant,
   salt-tolerant to a relatively high degree, and through its wind- and
   animal-dispersed seeds, it quickly becomes established as a weed along
   degraded roadsides, lagoon edges and in overgrazed native pastures. Has
   a preference for and is often dominant in areas of abandoned
   cultivation especially sandy soils in areas of low rainfall. It is
   assumed to be an indicator of over-cultivation.
