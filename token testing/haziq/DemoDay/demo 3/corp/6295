   around the mouth of the Amazon river. In Muaritius it is often found on
   rocky hills and on land strewn with boulders of all sizes, sometimes in
   the shade of trees. Under cultivation yields of between 60-90 t/ha of
   green leafs every 2 years can be obtained, which compare to 2-3 t of
   dry fibre.
