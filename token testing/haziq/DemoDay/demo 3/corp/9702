   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small, evergreen fan palm whose stem usually
   remains below ground or runs just along the surface. In some cases, it
   develops an erect or arching trunk that may lift the whorl of leaves
   60-240 cm above ground. The palmate leaves are 60-90 cm across and
   green or bluish green. The cluster of leaves gets about 120-180 cm high
   with a similar spread. In the wild, saw palmetto often grows in clumps
   20 or more feet in diameter. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. USE: It is a
   beautiful little palm and richly deserves a place in the ornamental
   landscape. The silver form is especially attractive. Plant saw
   palmettos in front of clumps of larger palms, or even underneath large
   palms. They look good massed in clumps in mixed borders, or as framing
   hedges. Use as accents to trees or in foundation plantings. COMMON
   NAMES: Saw palmetto. FURTHER INF: It can be found in south-eastern
   United States. It occurs naturally on the coastal plain from South
   Carolina to south-eastern Louisiana. It grows in a wide range of
   habitats from seaside sand dunes and dry scrub to moist forests, pine
   flatwoods and even wetlands. It can be the dominant ground cover in
   certain south-eastern pine forests.
