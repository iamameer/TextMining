   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 10-35 m in height, with a
   round, heavy crown of dense, dark foliage. The flowers bloom with great
   profusion, and the trees can be seen from great distances. USE: The
   seeds are edible. The hard central portion of the fruit is used to kill
   animals. The bark has laxative and antiseptic properties, and the
   seeds, flowers and roots are used as medicine. The bark is chewed and
   sprayed over swollen cheeks. The bark may also be boiled in water used
   for bathing newly born babies to heal body rashes. The tree is grown
   for shade as an ornamental, avenue tree and in coffee plantations. Also
   planted for revegetation and as a living fence. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: African tulip tree. FURTHER INF: The species
   is found throughout tropical Africa and is widely grown as an
   ornamental. It grows naturally in Africa in secondary forests in the
   high forest zone and in deciduous, transition, and savannah forests. It
   colonizes even heavily eroded sites, though form and growth rate suffer
   considerably on difficult sites. It develops best in fertile, deep,
   well-drained loams. Soil texture may range from loamy sands to clays,
   pH is between 4.5-8, and soil drainage may vary from poor to excessive.
