   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, erect, sometimes spiny deciduous tree
   reaching 9-15 m in height. The fruit is a pyriform to subglobose pome,
   2-3 cm in diameter in wild forms and up to 15 cm in cultivars, brown,
   reddish-brown or yellow in colour. USES The fruit is eaten fresh, in
   fruit salads, canned, dried or candied. The timber can be used for
   furniture. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Fruits ripen 4-5 months after
   blossom. COMMON NAMES Sand pear, Apple pear, Chinese pear, Japanese
   pear, Asian pear, Oriental pear, Nashi, Poire orientale, Apel jepang,
   Lai, Peras, Sali, Le. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: P. serotina, P.
   sinensis. Sand pear is native of northern-eastern and eastern Asia.
   Cultivars differ in thier chilling requirements, but generally it needs
   250-1000 hours under 7Â°C to overcome the dormancy period. In the
   tropics overcast skies during the rainy season and drought reduce the
   chilling requirements. Protection against wind is important, especially
   for large fruited cultivars, since the fruit can be damaged even by
   rubbing against leaves. Frost during flowering and fruit causes
   considerable crop losses. Most pear cultivars require cross-polination
   to set good crops. During dormancy the tree is tolerant of drought and
   flooding. Average annual fruit yields in Japan are 25-40 t/ha and up to
   45 t/ha have been obtained.
