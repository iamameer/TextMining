   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION
   A fast-growing medium sized to tall evergreen or deciduous tree. It is
   rarely exceeding 25 m in height in plantations, but wild trees over 40
   m have been recorded. USES It is the source of natural rubber used
   mainly in tire production. The seeds contain a semi-drying oil that is
   extracted and used in soaps. The seeds also contain linamarin and
   linase. KILLING T Some varieties will not tolerate -1°C and others not
   4 to 5°C. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. The tree begin to produce seeds after about 5-6 years, come
   into full seed production within 6-10 years and the economic life is
   25-35 years but in the wild state the tree may live 100-200 years.
   Fruits ripen 150-180 days after fertilization. Tapping can begin at 6-7
   years and trees are often tapped for 180 days and then rested for 90
   days, usually during 'wintering' or heavy rains. It can tolerate 2-3
   months of drought in some areas, but a dry period of 1 months or more
   may cause partial or complete leaf fall. COMMON NAMES Rubber, Para
   rubber, Natural rubber, Karet, Caoutchouc, Caucho, Getah asli, Kausuu,
   Jaang, Yang phara, Cao su. FURTHER INF Rubber is indigenous to the
   tropical rainforests of Brazil. It can be grown at altitudes from sea
   level to 600 m, but it performs best below 200 m, and most rubber is
   grown between 15°N and 10°S. Gently sloping and rolling terrain with
   minimal oil erosion (<8° slope) is desirable. Photosynthesis pathway C
   3. It is best adapted to moderately humid to humid conditions, and
   during dry seasons the tree may shed all of its leaves. Temporary
   waterlogging with flowing water causes littke damage. Strong winds can
   be harmful. Average yield of dry rubber is 300-400 kg/ha, optimum yield
   is 2 t/ha in the fifth year. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species.
