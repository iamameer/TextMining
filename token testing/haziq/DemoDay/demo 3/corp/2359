   Notes
   KILLING T: The rhizome in its dormant state underground can withstand
   -5Â°C. USE: The rhizome retain their crisp texture even when cooked.
   Thread-like mucilaginous strands exude from cut or broken surfaces when
   the pieces are pulled apart. Starch obtained from the storage rhizome
   has properties similar to that from arrowroot. Immature leaves
   including the petioles are used as greens. Mature seeds and carpets are
   eaten, both are reported by the Chinese to have medicinal qualities.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial herb, growing 120-200 days per year. COMMON
   NAMES: Sacred lotus, Lotus, East Indian lotus. FURTHER INFO: Storage
   rhizomes can be harvested after 120 days in warm climates and after 150
   to 180 days or after the leaves die in cold weather in cool climates.
   At harvest, the water is drained and the fragile rhizomes are dug
   carefully. In some farms in Japan, high pressure water stream is used
   to wash away the mud and expose the storage rhizomes. Yields vary from
   3.5 to 4.5 metric tons per ha. Higher yields can be obtained if flowers
   are removed.
