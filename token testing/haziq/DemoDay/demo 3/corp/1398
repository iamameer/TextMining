   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Trailing and twining herbaceous legume, with an erect
   basal stem and with the ability to climb to over 10 m up appropriate
   frameworks such as trees. It has strong woody taproot and rootstock.
   Leaves trifoliolate. Leaflets 7.5 cm long and 4 cm wide. Flowers
   whitish to greenish yellow papilionate. Pod 3-8 cm long, and 5-8 mm
   broad. USE: Mainly used as permanent pasture. Useful for cool season
   standover and agroforestry. KILLING T: The top is killed by frost, but
   the plant will regrow from the rootstock. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial,
   growing spring to summer. Pods usually mature 30-60 days after
   flowering. COMMON NAMES: Perennial horse gram, Acher axillaris,
   Axillaris. FURTHER INF: Synonym: Dolichos axillaris, Clitoria
   vividiflora. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is best adapted to
   low altitudes in the subtropics and higher altitudes, up to 2250 m, in
   the tropics. Its latitudinal range is between 16°N and 31°S. Very
   drought tolerant, surviving up to 8-months hot dry spells, but has no
   tolerance of waterlogging . Grows best under relatively mild conditions
   (optimum day night temperature 26/21ºC). Commences growth earlier in
   the season than most other warm season legumes. Tops are killed by
   frost, but plants recover from basal shoots. Generally poor long-term
   persistence in frosted areas.Dry matter yields may be 10-16 t/ha under
   irrigation and 3-4 t/ha under rainfed conditions.
