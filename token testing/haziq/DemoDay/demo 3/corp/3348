   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An evergreen tree (feather palm) reaching 7-20 m in
   height and 30-65 cm in trunk diameter. Roots black, very strong,
   extending up to 10 from the stem and going as deep as 3 m. USES All
   parts of the palm are used, and for a multitude of products. It
   contains large quantities of starshy sap in its trunk. The sap is
   converted to sugar when the palm flowers at 7-10 years of age and can
   be extracted from the male inflorescence stalks. The palm sugar is used
   in dishes, sweets, drinks and preserves. Young leaves, still white, are
   eaten in the same way as palm cabbage. Palm beetles are reared on
   fallen stems and consumed raw, fried or cooked. The leaf sheats, roots
   and the pith of the trunk are extracted for fibers used in the
   manufacture of brushes, roofs, fishing nets, cordage on ships, hats and
   to reinforce concrete. Sago starch can be extracted and used to prepare
   food. The fibers are very durable in sea water. It is also a source of
   honey and has medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. It begins
   to flower when it is 7-10 years old. The peduncles of the male
   inflorescences are tapped daily for about 60-90 days. Flowering
   continues for about 2 years, after which the palm dies. COMMON NAMES

   It can be found at elevations between sea level and 1400 m. Wild it
   occur in primary or secondary forests, especially on sites poor in
   nutrients and mesic sites such as denuded hillsides. The green peel of
   the fruit is poisonous and can cause serious skin infection on contact.
   Sugar yields may be about 70 kg/day per ha or 25 t/ha per year. Sago
   yields may be up to 100-150 kg/tree.
