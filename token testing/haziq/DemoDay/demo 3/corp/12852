   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to up to 6 m
   in height and 4 m in width at a fast rate. The leaves are alternate,
   8-12 cm long, with each leaf composed of eight to twelve oval leaflets.
   The flowers are yellow and appear early in the season forming pods in
   late June or early July. As the pods ripen, they crack and burst,
   spreading the seeds. The young bark is smooth and olive green and
   becomes less vivid in colour as the bark ages. The flowers are

   fatty oil and up to 36% protein. The young pods can be cooked and used
   as a vegetable. The whole plant is used in the treatment of cancer of
   the breast, and the orifice to the womb, and for dysmenorrhoea and
   other gynaecological problems. A fibre obtained from the bark is used
   for making cordage. A blue dye is obtained from the leaves. The plant
   can be grown as a hedge. It is quite wind-resistant and can also be
   planted in a shelterbelt. The plant has an extensive root system and
   can be used for erosion control, especially on marginal land. Because

   plant. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Siberian pea tree, Pea
