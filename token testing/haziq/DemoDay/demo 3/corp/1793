   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a nearly evergreen tree reaching 5-15 m in height
   with a round crown. The trunk can grow as large as 1 m in diameter,
   bole short with many branches. Leaves blue-green, alternate,
   bipinnately compound, hairless, 6-14 cm long. USE: The pod can be eaten
   as a fresh fruit or conserved in its own sweet fresh juice. If the dry
   pod is ground, it gives a flour that can be mixed with a little water
   and eaten immediately. The pods are eaten by livestock and the flowers
   are a source of honey. The wood is used as fuel and the gum has
   physical and chemical properties similar to gum arabic. Foliage
   extracts have shown antibacterial activity and the bark, branches, gum
   and foliage are used against gastritis and as an antiseptic,
   antidysenteric and emollient. It can be used for erosion control and as
   an ornamental. It can fix atmospheric nitrogen. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: White algarrobo. FURTHER INF: It is found in
   arid and semi-arid regions with groundwater, such as drainage channels
   and along groundwater sinks. It is a common ruderal weed, coming up
   singly and in groups along roadsides, around habitations, on refuse
   dumps and in other disturbed habitats.
