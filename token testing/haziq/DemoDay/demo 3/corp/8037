   shrub, 30-60 cm high, twigs usually green or purplish, subquadrangular,
   clothed with soft spreading hairs, often woody at the base. USE: It is
   widely cultivated, not only for its medicinal properties but also
   culinary purposes. It is considered a sacred plant in India where it is
   used in religious ceremonies, hence the name 'holy' or 'sacred' basil.

   planting, and two weeks after every harvest during the growing season.
   It attains full bloom stage (maturity) 65-70 days after transplanting.
