   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Tufted grass up to 150 cm tall, often sticky, with a
   characteristic odour of molasses or cumin. Pubescent leaf-blades.
   Panicle 10-30 cm. USE: Fodder and pasture. Oil obtained from the grass
   is used as a mosquito repellent. Can be used for erosion control.
   KILLING T: Repeated heavy frost will kill it. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Molasses grass, Gordura. FURTHER INF: It is
   native of tropical Africa. It occurs naturally in bush, shady places,
   at forest edges and in open grassland, often on steep, rocky slopes.
   The latitudinal range of molasses grass is 16-30.5°N. In Kenya it can
   be grown at elevations between 1500-2350 m, generally grown from sea
   level to 2500 m. Found in areas with annual rainfall between 750-2500
   mm, mostly between 1000-2000 mm. Occurs in areas with average annual
   temperatures from 18-21 (-25)ºC and mean temperature of the coldest
   month between 6 and 15ºC. Higher growth rate at 30ºC than at 20ºC.
   Grows on a variety of well-drained soils, with surface textures ranging
   from sands to medium clays. Tolerant of low fertility, pH from 4.5-8.4,
   and high aluminium. Responds to improved fertility. Intolerant of
   salinity. Annual dry matter yields are mostly of the order of 5-10
   t/ha, but vary from 2-20 t/ha, depending largely on moisture
   availability and N fertility. Listed as a weed in many countries.
