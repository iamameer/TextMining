   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a slender, erect to prostrate grass reaching 40-110
   cm in height, with extensively creeping, rather wiry rhizomes. Leaves
   bright green, glabrous or scantily hairy, 8-20 cm long, 5-12 mm wide.
   Panicle mostly 15-25 cm long. USE: Cultivated for hay, silage and as
   permanent pasture. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. It provides the best
   average yield the first 3 years. COMMON NAMES: Nile grass. FURTHER INF:
   It is native of eastern and southern Central Africa, where it grows
   naturally in seasonally flooded valley bottoms, along rivers, in swamps
   and damp grassland. It can be found in both tropical and subtropical
   zones of Africa, from sea level to 2000 m. Occurs in areas with
   625-2000 mm annual rainfall and average annual temperatures between
   16-26Â°C. It grows in poorly drained soils with textures ranging from
   sandy to heavy clays, with an apparent preference for the former. Has
   been successfully cultivated on moist, poorly or well-drained soils,
   with pH from 4.3-7.3. It is susceptible to iron deficiency. It also
   grows well in well-drained soils provided periods of moisture deficit
   are relatively short. Remains green with light frost but tops killed by
   heavy frost. Photosynthesis pathway C3. It can become a weed and it is
   difficult to plough out. Dry matter yields are usually 4-12 t/ha, but
   from as low as 2, and up to 18 t/ha.
