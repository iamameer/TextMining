   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A biennial herb with swollen tuberous white-fleshed
   taproot, which may be globular or flattened and lacking a neck; leaves
   light to medium green, hairy or bristly, stalked, lyrate-pinnatifid,
   30-50 cm long, stem-leaves sometimes glaucous with clasping base;
   flowers bright yellow, sepals spreading: petals 6-10 mm long, those in
   anthesis close together and commonly overtopping the unopened buds;
   outer 2 stamens curved outwards at base and much shorter than inner
   stamens; fruit 4-6.5 cm long, with long tapering beak, on
   divaricate-ascending pedicels 3.2-6.5 cm long; seeds blackish or
   reddish-brown, 1.5-2 mm in diameter. USES: Turnips are one of the most
   commonly grown and widely adapted root crops, as a general farm crop or
   home-garden crop. Roots are eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable and the
   tops used as a potherb such as spinach. Roots also grown for feeding to
   livestock during fall and winter. The powdered seed is said to be a
   folk remedy for cancer. The root when boiled with lard is used for
   breast tumors. The stems and leaves are said to be a remedy for cancer,
   while a salve derived from the flowers is said to help skin cancer. The
   root starch can be used to produce bio-ethanol. KILLING T.: Unhardened
   plants can survive -4°C, while fully-hardened spring types can survive
   -10 to -12°C, and hardened winter turnip can survive short periods of
   exposure to -15 to -20°C. GROWING PERIOD: Biennial, usually grown as an
   annual, growing 40-80 days for harvest as vegetable, and 55-80 days for
   harvest of the root. COMMON NAMES: Turnip, turnip rape, navet, nabo
   forrajero, nabo rutabaga, kohl-rube, koolraap. FURTHER INF.: Scientific
   synonyms: B. campestris var rapa L., B. campestris var rapifera L.
   Turnip is native of central and southern Europe. Cultivated in Europe
   for over 4000 years, probably native to central and southern Europe,
   now spread throughout world, including most parts of the tropics. In
   the tropics, it is suitable for elevations above 1000 m and only very
   few cultivars can be grow at low elevations. Turnip is basically a cool
   climate crop, resistant to frost and mild freezes. Temperatures below
   10°C cause bolting. Turnips do well in deep, friable, highly fertile
   soil with pH of 5.5-6.8; sandy loams are used for early markets roots
   and greens. Their short growing season makes them very adaptable as a
   catch crop. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Rain through Tropical Thorn to
   Moist Forest Life Zones, it is reported to tolerate an annual
   precipitation of 3500 to 4100 mm, an annual temperature of 3.6 to
   27.4°C and a pH of 4.2 to 7.8. Light shade is sometimes beneficial for
   plants grown for leaf consumption and the plant is drought-resistant.
   Yields are normally between 20-25 t/ha or 2-2.5 kg/m2. 2000-2500 liters
   of ethanol have been obtained in research trials. Cross-pollination, by
   various insects, is necessary for good seed production. Seed is sown
   thinly in spring, summer or autumn in drills at a seed rate of 1.1-2.2
   kg/ha. Seedlings then thinned to stand 5-15 cm apart in rows 0.3-0.9 m
   apart. Cultivate shallowly for weed control. Add lime to soil to
   correct pH to 5.5-6.8. Only light applications of fertilizer are
   justified, such as 450-675 kg/ha of 4-12-4. When turnips are seeded as
   an autumn crop following a crop that has been well fertilized, no
   additional fertilizer may be necessary. Seed may be broadcast on
   fertile, well-prepared seedbeds where weed control will not be
   difficult. Turnips may be intercropped with maize, and as such they are
   shade-tolerant, or they may be used as a catch crop after early
   vegetables. It is not advisable to grow turnips after a root crop. Good
   rotation helps to control diseases. Best grown after clover, beans,
   peas or grass crop.
   Roots may be harvested in 45-80 days. They are harvested for bunching
   when 5 cm in diameter, and for topped turnips when 7.5 cm in diameter.
   Turnip greens may be harvested when plants are young and tender. For
   early spring market, turnips are pulled, washed, their tops left on,
   tied in bunches, and marketed. Flavor and texture are not improved by
   storage. They should not be left in the ground where temperatures near
   freezing occur; in milder areas they may be left in field until
   desired. They may be stored in pits or piles, in well-drained soils.
   Piles should not be more than 2.6 m wide nor more than 2 m deep to
   prevent heating at the center. For good aeration, wooden chutes are
   inserted at intervals of 2.5-3 m in the pile. A ditch is dug around the
   base of pile for water runoff. Alternate layers of straw and soil are
   used as covering for pit storage. For indoor storage, crates or small
   piles laid on earth cellar floors are satisfactory. Small quantities of
   turnips may be stored in a cool cellar and covered with moistened clean
   sand to keep them from drying out. Storage temperature in a cellar or
   in a cold storage room should remain between 0° and 1.5°C, with a
   relative humidity of 90-95%.
   Per 100 g, the root is reported to contain 30 calories, 91.5 g H2O, 1.0
   g protein, 0.2 g fat, 6.6 g total carbohydrate, 0.9 g fiber, 0.7 g ash,
   39 mg Ca, 30 mg P, 0.5 mg Fe, 49 mg Na, 268 mg K, a trace of b-carotene
   equivalent, 0.04 mg thiamine, 0.07 mg riboflavin, 0.6 mg niacin, and 36
   mg ascorbic acid. Per 100 g, the leaf is reported to contain 23
   calories, 92.7 g H2O, 1.9 g protein, 0.2 g fat, 4.6 g total
   carbohydrate, 1.0 g fiber, 0.6 g ash, 168 mg Ca, 52 mg P, 2.6 mg Fe, 78
   mg Na, 420 mg K, 1330 mg b-carotene equivalent, 0.10 mg thiamine, 0.18
   mg riboflavin, 0.7 mg niacin, and 47 mg ascorbic acid. Seed oil
   contains large amount of erucic, linoleic, and linolenic acids.
