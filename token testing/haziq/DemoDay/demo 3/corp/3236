   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION Morphologically intermediate between A. cherimola and
   A. squamosa, deciduous and reaching 3-10 m in height. USES The fruit,
   which contain 18% sugar, is normally eaten fresh. The pulp can be
   utilized as a flavouring of ice-cream, sherberts and beverage. The
   green fruit and seed have vermicidal and insecticidal properties.
   KILLING T Young trees will not tolerate prolonged temperatures between
   -3.9 to -6.7Â°C, whereas mature trees can withstand those temperatures
   with slight to moderate damage. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Grafted trees
   begin to produce fruit in 3 to 4 years. About 100 to 120 days are
   required from flowering to fruit maturity. COMMON NAMES Atemoya,
   Cherimoya, Cherimoyer, Custard apple. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym:
   A. cherimola x A. squamosa. Atemoya is a hybrid between A. cherimola
   (cherimoya) and A. squamosa (sugar apple). In the tropics the tree is
   only grown at altitudes above 1000 m and will not survive under lowland
   conditions. It is grown in subtropical lowlands. The tree grows in
   areas with a dry season. It thrives in a relative humidity above 70%
   and is favoured by windbreaks. Mature trees produce from 23 to 34 kg
   per tree, possibly more with good management or 5-20 t/ha per year.
