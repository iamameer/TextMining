   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A plant with a fleshy, watery stem made up of large,
   spirally arranged, overlapping leaf bases called sheaths. The plant
   stands erect, 1.5-6 m tall and the stem has a diameter of up to 30 cm
   at the base. Leaves are 1-2 m long and up to 60 cm wide. Fruits may be
   10-25 cm long, green, yellow or brown, cylindric or angled, and seeded
   or seedless. USES It is grown as a fiber crop. The fiber was once used
   for marine cordage because of its durability in salt water. Demand for
   the fiber as a pulp product has been increasing. The fruit are
   inedible. GROWING PERIOD Perennial, growing 1.5-3.0 years before first
   harvest and with a economical life of 6-15 years. COMMON NAMES Manila
   hemp, Abaca, Canamo de Manila, Chanure de manille, Abaca manila, Pisang
   manila, Pisang benang, Pisang utan, Agotai, Agotag, Amoguid, Lanton,
   Samoro, Chuoi soi. FURTHER INF Manila hemp is native of the Philippines
   and it is a plant of the hot humid tropics adapted to an average
   relative humidity of about 80%. The present zone of successful
   cultivation lies within ti latitudinal range 15°N and 5°S. In the
   Philippines it is usually grown in regions below 500 m in elevations
   but it can be grown in the tropics at altitudes between sea level and
   1100 m. Three commonly grown clones are: 1) Tangongon: 4.5-5.5 m tall,
   not exacting in regard to soil conditions and grows well on heavy clay
   soils, easily blown down, common in the Philippines. 2) Bungulanon:
   short-lived (5-6 years), cannot be grown on stiff clay or dry sandy
   soils, common in Central America. 3) Maguindanao: long-lived (15 years
   or more), cannot be grown in heavy clays, the root system is shallow
   and it is easily damaged by high winds. In the Philippines, the annual
   fiber yield ranges from 0.31-1.71 t/ha, while in Ecuador, yields are
   between 1.5-2.5 t/ha.
