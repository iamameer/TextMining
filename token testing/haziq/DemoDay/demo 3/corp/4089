   15 m. Under cultivation it is usually pruned down to 0.5-1.5 m and
   trained as a low spreading bush.
   KILLING T

   GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Harvest of leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a
   maximum at 7-10 years. The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes
   270-360 days to matureand seed are normally produced after 4-5 years.
   The economic life of the plant is about 40-45 years, but sometimes the
   shrub are kept in production 60-70, or even 100 years.

   FURTHER INF
   Assam tea can be grown in tropical lowland up to about 1000 m in
   elevation. Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are beneficial.
   It is sensitive to drought and cold. It thrives with fairly high
   relative humidity (67-85%). One ton of tea removes 45-60 kg N, 4-7 kg P
   and 20-30 kg K from the field. Optimum yield is relatively high to
   about 3.0 t/ha.
