   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an extremely slow-growing broadleaf evergreen shrub
   or tree reaching 3-13 m or even 20 m in height, with the same spread
   casting light shade, often with a beautiful array of multiple trunks
   and a rounded canopy. The leaves are 2-5 cm long, leathery and dark
   green. Flowers are deep blue in clusters, the old flowers fading to a
   light silvery-blue. The berries are small, heart-shaped and yellow.
   USE: It is grown as an ornamental, e.g. as a lawn tree, along sidewalks
   and parking places. The wood has medicinal properties and is used as a
   mild laxative and diuretic. For tonsilitis it is given in powdered
   form. Specially useful for rheumatoid arthritis, also in chronic
   rheumatism and gout, relieving the pain and inflammation between the
   attacks, and lessening their recurrence if doses are continued. It acts
   as an acrid stimulant, increasing heat of body and circulation, when
   the decoction is taken hot and the body is kept warm, it acts as a
   diaphoretic, and if cool as a diuretic. Also largely used for secondary
   syphilis, skin diseases and scrofula. The leaves are sometimes used as
   a substitute for soap. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Lignumvitae. FURTHER INF: It has a wide distribution in the Florida
   Keys, the Caribbean and Central America, where it occurs wild in
   lowland dry forests. It can be grown in full sun or partial shade on a
   wide variety of soils, including alkaline. Plants will easily tolerate
   wet or dry soil, wind, and salt, making it an ideal choice especially
   for seaside plantings.
