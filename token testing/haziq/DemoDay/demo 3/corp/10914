   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tall evergreen tree with scaly, pale green or
   brown bark. Leaves alternate, simple, dotted with glands, blade
   oblong-lanceolate, elliptic or oblong-elliptic, 3-15 x 1.4-5 cm. Fruit
   a berry, at 1st green and ellipsoidal, later subspherical and turning
   purplish, 3-5 cm in diameter, skin leathery, glandular. Seeds 2 or more
   with oily endosperm, compressed, more or less cordate, yellow-brown,
   1-1.5 cm long. USE: Fruit ediblem all parts have a hot peppery taste.
   The leaves and seeds are sometimes used to add flavour to curries.
   Leaves, pods and seeds are fed to livestock. It makes good timber for
   building and furniture, also used as firewood. The heartwood contains
   sesquiterpenoids that can be used against armyworms widely occurring
   African crop pests. Dried bark is commonly used as a remedy for
   stomach-ache, constipation, toothache, cough, fever, muscle pains, weak
   joints and general body pains. Fresh roots are boiled and mixed with
   soup for the prevention of diarrhoea. Bathing with a leaf decoction is
   used as a cure for several unspecified skin diseases. The inner bark is
   reddish, bitter and peppery and has a variety of applications. It
   provides treatment for the common cold; dried and ground to a snuff it
   is used to clear sinuses; and it is chewed, or smoke from the burning
   bark inhaled, as a remedy for chest complaints. The bark, roots or
   leaves can be boiled in water and the decoction drunk to treat malaria,
   but this causes violent vomiting. It is a good shade tree and is used
   as an ornamental. Fallen leaves provide green manure and mulch. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Pepper-bark tree. FURTHER INF: It
   occurs in lowland rainforest, upland dry evergreen forest and its
   relicts in secondary bushland and grassland, also on termitaria in
   swamp forest.
