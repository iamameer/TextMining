   a densely leafy crown, but often shrubby. Bole without buttresses, Bark
   smooth, grey. Leaves composite, 5-13 cm long, with an odd terminal
   leaflet and usually 2 pairs of opposite or alternate leaflets, the
   lower pair being somewhat smaller; leaflets mostly 3.5-10 x 2.5-5 cm,
   elliptic to broadly elliptic, sometimes slightly obovate. Fruits
   usually abundant, more or less circular and flattened, but sometimes
   almost globose, up to 2.5 cm in diameter, densely velvety and black.
   USE: The fruit is red, with a sweet-sour, astringent flavour similar to

   refreshing fruit pulp can also be soaked in water and drunk as a
   beverage. Leaves are edible but bitter. The wood is hard, durable,

   houses and flooring and also as firewood and charcoal. Bark and leaves

   shadowy canyons and gallery forests. It is found from Senegal to Sudan
   along the southern border of the Sahel. In Ghana, it is found along
   transition zones bordering high forest, in riverian forest of the
   savannah woodland, in coastal scrub, and in riparian vegetation.
