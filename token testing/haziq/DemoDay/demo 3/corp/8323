   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 7-20 m in height, although
   it can reach 30 m. Crown large, spreads wide with branches low down on
   a stout bole, bark dark grey brown, thick, fissured. Leaves alternate,
   dark green, bipinnate to 30 cm long. Pods, pink brown to dark brown
   when mature, about 45 cm long and 2 cm wide. USE: Seed, pods and leaves
   are edible and pods also used as fodder. Flowers produce nectar. Wood
   is used for small implements and as fuel. Gum and tannin can be
   extracted from the pods. Bark and pods are poisonous to fish. Bark is
   used as a mouthwash, vapour inhalant for toothache, or for ear
   complaints. It is macerated in baths for leprosy and used for
   bronchitis, pneumonia, skin infections, sores, ulcers, bilharzia,
   washes for fever, malaria, diarrhoea, violent colic and vomiting,
   sterility, venereal diseases, guinea worm, oedema and rickets, and as a
   poison antidote. Leaves are used in lotions for sore eyes, burns,
   haemorrhoids and toothache. Seed is taken for tension, and pulp for
   fevers, as a diuretic and as a mild purgative. Roots are used in a
   lotion for sore eyes. The tree is a useful windbreak, shade tree and
   used in agroforestry. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. First fruiting after
   about 8 years and full bearing after 15-20 years. COMMON NAMES: African
   locust bean. FURTHER INF: It can be found at elevations between sea
   level and 300 m. Range of natural occurrence is 5-15°N. It occurs on a
   wide range of natural and semi-natural communities such as open
   savannah woodlands, but it is most conspicuous and abundant in
   anthropic communities, principally bush fallow and wooded farmland
   where cultivation is semi-permanent. The tree can also grow on rocky sl
