   Ecocrop code 4646

   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small, spreading, evergreen tree. The fruit is a
   hesperidium. The endocarp (edible portion) is divided into 10-14
   sections, separated by thin septa and contains no seed. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. USE: The fruit is edible, it has a sweet-sour taste, it
   lacks seed, and is easy-to-peel. Its significance on the fresh fruit
   market has therefore increased. A particular advantage for marketing
   lies in its early ripening, which allows producers to bring their fruit
   about two months before oranges and clementines onto the market.
   Disadvantageous is that, when the fruit is internally ripe and most
   suitable for consumption, it still lacks "external" quality. The
   irregular coloration of the fruit and sometimes an unusually rough peel
   tend to make it unattractive to the consumer. Moreover, the yields are
   not sufficiently reliable to satisfy the producer. COMMON NAMES:
   Satsuma mandarine. FURTHER INF: Killing temperature -5 C. (See also
   under Citrus ssp.)
