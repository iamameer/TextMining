   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub of 2-5 m or a small tree up to 8 m tall,
   single or multi-stemmed from the base and with a spreading canopy. USES
   The wood can be used for fuel and small turnery. The tree can provide
   low shelter, it can be used as an ornamental and is a pollen source for
   bees. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Sandplain wattle, Colony
   wattle, Murrays wattle, Powder bark wattle. FURTHER INF Sandplain
   wattle occurs in central western and eastern Australia within the
   latitudinal range 21-33Â°S at elevations between sea level and 700 m. It
   is mainly found on gentle country, sandy plains, on, or between sand
   dunes and on sandy beds of shortlived seasonal streams. It is nitrogen
   fixing, drought hardy, and fire resistant. Its capacity to regenerate
   vigorously both from seed and vegetatively suggests that it has a
   potential to become a weed on favourable sites.
