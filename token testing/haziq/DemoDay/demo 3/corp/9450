   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A relatively small, very spiny, creeping and
   tillering, almost stemless palm reaching 1-5 m in height, growing in
   compact clumps caused by successive branching at the base. Roots not
   extending to great depth. Leaves pinnate, 4-7 m long. Fruits
   exceptionally firm and crisp for a tropical fruit, globose, reddish
   brown, 2.5-10 x 5-8 cm. USES The ripe fruit flesh sweet and is mostly
   eaten fresh. The fruit may also be candied or canned and unripe fruits
   are used as pickles. The seeds of some forms are edible. The palms form
   an impregnable hedge and the very spiny leaves are also used for
   fences, the leaflets for thatching. The bark of the petioles may be
   used for matting. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. The tree starts flowering
   about 3-4 years after sowing. Harvesting takes place at a fruit age of
   5-7 months. The palm can be productive for several decades. COMMON
   NAMES Salak palm, Snake fruit, Salak, Yingan, Sala, Lizard-skinned
   salak, Roftan-zalak. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: S. edulis, Zalacca
   edulis. Salak palm occurs at elevations between sea level and 500 m in
   the humid tropics throughout the Malay Archipelago. Because of its
   superficial root system the palm requires a high water table during
   most of the year. Young palms require heavy shade which may be reduced
   after about one year. Annual yields may vary from 5-15 t/ha.
