   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A large handsome evergreen tree, reaching a height of
   10-30 m and a girth of 2-2.5 m. The tree branches low, with a dense
   crown or can form a relatively straight clean bole, depending on the
   growing conditions. The bark is brown, rough when old and the leaves
   are shining, 5-10 cm long and smelling strongly of camphor when
   crushed. USES Logs, stumps, branches and leaves can be distilled to
   give crystalline camphor and camphor oil. The oil has medicinal
   properties and it is used in the manufacture of disinfectants,
   celluloid, and other chemical preparations. The tree is also extracted
   for Ho leaf oil used as a source of linalool. Fractionation of
   camphor-free oil provides an oil rich in safrole, usually described as
   Chinese sassafras oil and used in soap and perfume manufacture. The
   tree can also be planted as an avenue tree and as an ornamental shade
   tree. KILLING T May withstand temperatures down to -9°C, though
   unlignified twigs may be killed earlier. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. In
   Japan the tree is said to commence producing seed at the age of 20-25
   years. COMMON NAMES Formosa camphor tree, Japan camphor tree. FURTHER
   INF Scientific synonym: Camphora officinarum. The natural habitat of
   Formosa camphor tree is in eastern Asia between latitudes 10-34°N. For
   its best growth the tree requires a sheltered situation. Other plants
   do not grow well in its vicinity.
