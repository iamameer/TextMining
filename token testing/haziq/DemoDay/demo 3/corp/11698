   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a thornless tree reaching 10-15 m or even 20 m in
   height with a trunk diameter of 50-100 cm. Trees are typically branchy
   when young but may have a short, clear bole to 5 m in height when
   older. Leaves bipinnate, 20-25 cm long and 19-26 cm wide with a short
   petiole 19-25 cm long. USE: Leaves are browsed by cattle, f Flowers are
   a source on honey and wood used as fuel. The tree is planted for
   erosion control and the traditional retention by farmers of the tree in
   fields in parts of its natural range indicates the agroforestry
   potential of the species. In several areas in Nicaragua, it was used in
   a series of alley-cropping trials and has been intercropped with maize,
   sorghum and cowpea. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Aserillo,
   frijolillo, sipia, sipria (Spanish). FURTHER INF: It occupies a clearly
   defined, largely contiguous, distribution area. It has been found
   almost exclusively on the southern slopes of the hills of the Pacific
   watershed and is rarely, if ever, on the flat coastal plains. It is
   also notable that the distribution rarely overlaps with other Leucaena
   species. In El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, it occurs in the
   seasonally dry, tropical forest formations that extend throughout the
   Pacific coastal zone of Central America and Mexico. The soils where it
   is found are young, superficial and primarily of volcanic origin. They
   are extremely rocky, shallow, skeletal and generally freely drained.
