   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small irregular branched tree or a bushy shrub
   reaching 2-10 m in height and often wider than tall. Sapwood narrow
   light in colour, heartwood pinkish-brown to brown, tough and hard. The
   cream or white flowers appear in Spring or Summer. USES The wood is
   durable in the ground, it is used for round fencing material and
   firewood. The tree is useful for windbreak and shelter. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES Moonah, Rottnest Island teatree. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: M. pubescens. In Australia, the tree occurs
   naturally within the latitudinal range of 25.5-38.5Â°S at altitudes
   between sea level to 500 m. It is often found near the coast but
   extends to 500 km inland in places. It is found on a wide variety of
   parent rock and soil types and will adapt to many more when planted
   out. In natural situations it has been recorded on sandstones,
   limestones, travertines, granites and shales. Soils vary from shallow
   terra rossas to deep light coloured sandy podsols. Rainfall is usually
   in the range of 200 - 400 mm, but this species will thrive on
   well-drained sites with a rainfall of up to 650mm. It is mainly found
   on level to gently undulating country but it also colonizes narrow
   belts at the bases of small banks, low coastal plateaux, drainage lines
   and steep rocky slopes. It will tolerate wetness, drought, coastal
   exposure, lime, saline soil, smog and frost.
