   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A globose evergreen, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree
   attaining heights of up to 5-10 m (when not pruned). The root system of
   the mature coffee tree consists of: a taproot, which is often
   extensively branched, robust, and generally short (0.3 to 0.5 m), but
   may grow as long as 1.0 m in deep soils. A number of secondary roots
   develop from the taproot and grow vertically downwards. The lighter and
   more penetrable the soil, the deeper they will develop. Their role,
   together with that of the taproot, is to assist in anchorage and
   supplying water to the plant. Lateral roots, which are generally
   numerous, develop, often almost horizontally, and are further extended
   by a network of rootlets. They explore the superficial and richest
   layers of the soil. Their role is essentially to provide mineral
   nutrition to the plant. Its branches are opposite, long, flexible, and
   rather thin; its habit is semi-erect when young and spreading or
   pendulous when adult. The petiolate leaves are dark glossy green,
   simple, opposite, acuminate; having a short petiole with undulating
   margins and a slightly crinkled surface, they are 10-15 cm long and 4-6
   cm wide, sometimes bearing interpetiolar stipules. They have a
   prominent leaf midrib and lateral veins. Flowers produced in dense
   clusters along reproductive branches in the axils of the leaves. White,
   sweet scented, star-shaped and carried on stout but short peduncles.
   Bracteoles united, forming a cup-shaped epicalyx at the base of the
   flower. There are 5 calyx segments halfway the length, spreading out
   very widely at the anthesis and 5 stamens inserted in the corolla tube.
   Anthers carried on long, slender, upright filaments. It is about 90%
   autogamous (self-fertile) thus a great number of its flowers are
   fertilised before anthesis. Ovary inferior, 2 united unilocular
   carpels, each containing a single ovule attached to the base of the
   carpel wall. The ovary bears a slender style, which terminates in
   short, pointed bifid stigmas. The ovary is in the form of a drupe, and
   is commonly called a cherry. The cherry is ovoid or sub-globulous, red
   when ripe, 10-15 mm wide and 16-18 mm long, and consists of a coloured
   exocarp (skin), a fleshy, yellowish-white mesocarp (pulp) and two beans
   or seeds (8.5-12.5 mm long, ellipsoidal in shape and pressed together
   by flattened surface that is deeply grooved; outer surface convex)
   joined together along their flat sides. When one of the two ovaries
   aborts, the other develops into an ovoid bean, which is commercially
   known as a 'peaberry'. Each bean is protected by two coats. The first,
   the endocarp, is thin with a fibrous texture (parchment) and the
   second, the perisperm, is a very fine membrane (skin or silverskin)
   that more or less adheres to the bean. The size and shape of the beans
   differ depending on variety, environmental conditions, and cropping
   practices. On average, they are 10 mm long, 6-7 mm wide and 3-4 mm
   thick. They weigh 0.15-0.20 g. Dried seeds, after removal of the
   silvery skin, provide the coffee beans of commerce. The optimum
   temperature for the germination of coffee seeds is about 30°-32°C,
   below 10°C germination is very slow. USES: Food: Dried seeds (?beans?)
   are roasted, ground, and brewed to make 1 of the 2 most popular
   beverages in the world. In its native Ethiopia, it has been used as a
   masticatory since ancient times. Cooked in butter, it can be used to
   make rich flat cakes. Coffee is widely used as flavouring in ice cream,
   pastries, candies, and liqueurs. In Arabia, a fermented drink from the
   pulp is consumed. Fodder: Pulp and parchment are occasionally fed to
   cattle in India. Apiculture: Honeybees collect nectar and pollen from
   the flowers. The honey is light with a characteristic flavour. Mixed
   coffee-orange honey is very highly valued. Timber: Wood is hard, dense,
   durable, takes a polish well, and is suitable for tables, chairs and
   turnery. The bark can be made into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch.
   Soil improver: The pulp and parchment are used as manure and mulches.
   Annual litter fall from both shade and crop trees, including pruning
   residues, maintain soil organic matter levels and hence the cation
   exchange capacity; this reduces the risk of leaching losses and permits
   a more efficient use of any inorganic fertilizers applied.
   Intercropping: C. Arabica is often intercropped with food crops, such
   as corn, beans or rice, during the 1st few years. Poison: C. Arabica
   seeds contain caffeine, which has been described as a natural
   herbicide, selectively inhibiting germination of seeds of Amaranthus
   spinosus. Medicine: Reported to be analgesic, an aphrodisiac, anorexic,
   antidotal, cardiotonic, CNS-stimulant, counterirritant, diuretic,
   hypnotic, lactagogue and nervine. Coffee is a folk remedy for asthma,
   tropine poisoning, fever, flu, headache, jaundice, malaria, migraine,
   narcosis, nephrosis, opium poisoning, sores and vertigo. Other
   products: Coffelite, a type of plastic, is made from coffee beans.
   Coffee with iodine is used as a deodorant. KILLING T.: Some varieties
   have been reported to withstand -4°C. Temperatures at -5- -8°C may kill
   the plant within an hour or two. At temperatures from 0-2°C, which are
   not unusual in some production areas, the foliar tissue and green
   shoots are killed. This is manifested by almost complete defoliation of
   the shrubs, the drying out of the young branches (black tip), and with
   an appreciable loss in the harvest. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins
   to bear in 2-3 years, is in full bearing at 6-8 years, and produces
   economic yields for 30-40 years on average, though in some cases only
   10-15 years, and in others up to 50-70 years. Plants of 80-100 years
   are known. Fruits mature 210-270 days after flowering, and the growth
   cycle is 240-330 days. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): ka-phi, (Creole): kafe,
   (English): Abyssinian coffee, Arabian coffee, arabica coffee, Brazilian
   coffee, coffee, coffee tree, (Filipino): kafe, (French): café, caféier,
   (German): Bergkaffee, (Indonesian): kopi, (Khmer): kafae, (Spanish):
   café, cafeto, (Swahili): kahawa, (Thai): gafae, (Trade name): arabica
   coffee, (Vietnamese): Cà phê. FURTHER INF.: The generic name Coffea
   arabica is derived from the Arabic word used for the drink, which,
   despite its name, may have come from the region of Kefa in Ethiopia; it
   is indigenous to the wet highland forests of Ethiopia. It can in
   equatorial regions be grown at elevations from 1300 to 2800 m, with
   1500-1900 being usual, at 15°N or S it can be grown down to about 500
   m. In the subtropics it is grown from sea level to 1000 m. The
   latitudinal range is between 22°N and 27°S. With too much rainfall the
   plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and fruits. One
   to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform flowering.
   Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It will only
   flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Medium humidity is best,
   periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial but arabica require 2-3
   drier months for the initiation of flower buds. The photosynthesis
   pathway is C 3.
   Processing: The ripe fruits of coffee are normally processed in the
   production area. They go through a certain number of operations, the
   objectives of which are to extract the beans from their covering of
   pulp, mucilage, parchment and film, and to improve their appearance.
   Two techniques are used to obtain clean coffee beans: Wet processing in
   which the fresh fruit is processed in three stages: a) Removal of the
   pulp and mucilage and washing, b) Drying of parchment coffee, c)
   Removal of the inner coverings, parchment, and film (hulling). Dry
   processing which consists of two stages: Drying of the fruit (coffee
   berries or cherry coffee), and b) Removal of the dried coverings in a
   single mechanical operation (hulling). Optimum yield of clean dry
   coffee beans is 2-3 t/ha obtained in Kenya, while average yields are
   about 0.5 t/ha in Brazil and 0.9 t/ha in Africa. An important disease
   in coffee is leaf rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix, it is most
   serious at low altitudes and when trees are weakened by overbearing.
   Resistance breeding has reduced the severity of this disease. Just as
   severe is coffee berry disease caused by Colletotrichum coffeanum.
