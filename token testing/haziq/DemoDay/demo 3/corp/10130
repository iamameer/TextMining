   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a straight-stemmed tree reaching 3-14 m in height,
   with a smooth, green or yellowish-white, powdery bark. Fruits globose,
   6-10 cm in diameter, with a hard rind, glabrous, bluish-green when
   young, yellowish or orange when ripe, with a thick woody shell,
   containing many seeds embedded in a yellowish pulp. USE: The sweet-sour
   fruit pulp is edible. Leaves are eaten by livestock. Provides excellent
   firewood that burns even when wet. A mixture of ground roots and oil is
   rubbed on the skin as a fly repellent. A root decoction is taken as a
   remedy for gonorrhoea; fresh roots are used to treat snakebite. The
   bark and twigs are pounded, soaked in cold water and the infusion drunk
   to facilitate birth. The fruit pulp is used as a remedy for dysentery
   and as eardrops. Seeds have emetic properties. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: monkey orange, wild orange. FURTHER INF: It
   occurs in savannah forests all over tropical Africa in open woodland
   and rocky hills on light yellowish-brown to reddish-yellow, gritty
   sandy clay loams derived from granite and granodiorite rocks.
