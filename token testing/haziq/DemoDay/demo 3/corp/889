   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A deciduous and dioecious vine climbing to a height
   of 7-8 m. Under cultivation it is often grown on trellises about 1.8 m
   tall. The fruit, which is a matured ovary, is about the size of a
   chicken egg. It has a greenish brown skin densely covered with short
   hairs. The juicy flesh is fresh green and contains many small black
   edible seeds. USES The fruits are eaten fresh or used in jams and
   preserves. The plant is also used as an ornamental. KILLING T -1.5°C in
   the growing period. Prolonged periods below -9°C, or -10°C to -15°C for
   one hour can damage or kill dormant plants. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   Require 3 years to first bearing for cuttings, 4-6 years to first
   bearing for seedlings, and come into full bearing after 8-10 years. The
   plant has a long life and can crop heavily for many years. Some 40
   year-old vines are still productive in New Zealand. COMMON NAMES Kiwi,
   Yang tao, Chinese-grooseberry, Ichang gooseberry, Yangtze berry,
   Mao-erh-tao, Yang tao. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: A. chinensis.
   Kiwi is native of the southern part of Central China, where the plants
   grow naturally along the forest edges of the Yangtze Vally. Humidity
   should be moderate to high, an average of 50-70% is very suitable. Hail
   and strong winds may damage the crop. Kiwi requires some winter cold
   (300 to 500 hours below 7°C). Pollen is transferred by insects, chiefly
   bees. The fruit yield of 10 year old vines in full bearing may be 17-22
   t/ha.
