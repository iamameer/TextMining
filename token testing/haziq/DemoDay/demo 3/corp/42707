   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous, semi-deciduous, or almost evergreen
   tree reaching up to 27 m in height, with a straight bole up to 120 cm
   in diameter; occasionally swollen at the base, the erect to spreading
   branches form a heavy, usually rounded crown, bark smooth and pale in
   young trees, later becoming vertically fissured and cracked, brown to
   grey, especially on slow-growing trees. Leaves alternate, compound with
   3-6 pairs of opposite, thin, leathery leaflets. USE: The wood is hard,
   heavy, strong, stable and durable with a fine, even texture. It is
   widely used for railway sleepers, mining timber, batten doors and
   furniture, but is most valuable as a flooring timber owing to its
   stability, durability and handsome appearance. Wood is naturally
   resistant to decay caused by fungi and shows a marked resistance to
   termite attack. Also used as firewood and charcoal. Both heartwood and
   bark contain tannins. Decoctions of the bark are used to treat syphilis
   and to make a fortifying tonic. Can be planted as an ornamental in
   larger gardens and parks. The grey stems, dark green leaves, pinkish
   flowers and dark brown pods make it a very decorative tree. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: African teak, Rhodesian teak, Zambezi
   redwood, Zambian teak (English). FURTHER INF: In its natural range,
   from Tanzania to Zimbabwe, it is a dominant species in the dry, open,
   deciduous forest. It suffers adversely from dry-season fires and
   subsequent competition from thorny, fast-growing colonizer bushes. It
   is frost sensitive but can withstand some drought.
