   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A tree usually 30-40 m high, rarely to 50 m in the high
   forest. Trunk up to 2 m in diameter, bark usually smooth, greyish, 1-3
   cm thick and red internally, in the forest branching 10-20 m above
   ground level, much lower in exposed sites, crown wide and open or
   dense. Root system fairly superficial with large roots often seen on
   the surface. Leaves alternate, compound, bifoliate. USES: Seed pods
   contain an edible powdery pulp and Jatoba bark tea is a quite popular
   drink. Seeds are used as fodder. Timber used for carpentry, general
   construction, wheels and cogs, dugouts, shipbuilding, posts, looms,
   cartwheels, rail ties and for cabinetwork, musical instruments,
   interior trim, plywood, turnery, and veneer. The trunk yields gum (it
   contains a medicinal oil - the resin - which burns like kerosene) and
   the bark tannin. The bark is common in local folk medicine as a
   cure-all, being especially useful for coughs. Used as shade tree and
   has occasionally used for coffee shade, also grown as an ornamental.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Brazilian cherry. FURTHER
   INF.: It occupies a wide range of habitats. It has been reported in
   tropical dry forest, transition to pre-mountain moist forest, and
   tropical wet forest as well as subtropical moist forest. Tolerates not
   only poor fertility and waterlogging but also 4 months or more of
   drought, with temperatures typical of the wet lowland tropics, that is,
   diurnal temperature fluctuations are normally greater than seasonal
   temperature changes. The precipitation may be evenly distributed
   through the year or monsoonal. The tree develops best on ridges or
   slopes and high riverbanks.
