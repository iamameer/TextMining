   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tender, perennial, aquatic herb reaching about 60
   cm in height and 120 cm in spread. It has long, oval shaped leaves
   float on the water and white inflorescences standing up out of the
   water above the leaves. USE: The leaves and tubers are edible and the
   stalks have medicinal properties. The stems with their high juice
   content make soothing treatments for burns and scrapes and take the
   pain out of sunburn, if the juice is applied every hour until the
   redness fades. For a garden pond this is an excellent ornamental plant.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Cape pondweed, Water hawthorn,
   Cape asparagus. FURTHER INF: It occurs naturally in the winter rainfall
   areas of the Cape in South Africa. It was introduced into cultivation
   in Europe in the seventeenth century. It is cultivated and has
   naturalised in southern France and England. It is adapted to growing in
   ponds which dry up in summer. The dormant tubers sprout again as soon
   as the pools fill in autumn. It thrives in cold-water, going dormant in
   the summer heat and reappearing in the fall once the temperature starts
   to fall. The tubers survive the winter in deeper water at the bottom of
   ponds, also if the ponds freeze over, however the tubers are not very
   cold resistant. It thrives in rich clay and loamy soils. It does best
   in water from 15-60 cm deep but can also grow in wet soil but is then
   very restricted. It grows in full sun and under partial shade.
