   Notes
   A graceful deciduous tree up to 14m tall, often with a twisted trunk
   and a rather thin, spreading, narrow crown. Its graceful shape and
   feathery foliage make it an attractive tree. The drooping foliage gives
   the canopy a lovely soft look. This is one of the first trees to shoot
   in spring independently of the first spring rains and the new leaves
   are striking, being a soft, fresh green. One of the least thorny Acacia
   species. USE: The heartwood, in particular, is resistant to insect
   attack and fence poles of this wood have a very long lifespan. Also
   suited for ornamental work and as firewood. The flowers have a heavy
   perfume and are much frequented by bees. The leaves and pods are eaten
   by livestock. This attractive tree has potential as a garden tree.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Common hook thorn. FURTHER
   INF: Found naturally in a wide variety of habitats in woodland and
   wooded grassland, frequently along rivers and streams. An adaptable
   species growing from coastal scrub to mountain slopes at an altitude up
   to 1500m. In the south and east of southern Africa it is particularly
   common along stream banks. In these areas it is often a shrub. Inland
   it is a species of hillslopes (often dolerite) in bushveld and savanna.
   Tolerates low soil pH and is often found on sandy leached acidic soils
   in high rainfall areas.
