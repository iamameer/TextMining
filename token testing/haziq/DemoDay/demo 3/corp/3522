   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Spiny, evergreen, single-stemmed feather palm to 10-17 m.
   Some rare individuals are spineless. Palms usually found in clusters
   rarely solitary. USE: The fruit pulp is used to prepare juice and the
   kernel shell it contains an excellent oil similar that of to coconut
   and oil palm. The bud gives palmito. The immature endosperm gives a
   juice called vino de tucuma, used for a drink or in culinary
   preparations. A wine is made from the fermented sap of the spathe. The
   seed contains a hard white substance from which a fine edible fat can
   be extracted. The kernel shell is used for handicrafts (rings,
   bracelets, collars, etc.). The leaf fibers are extracted to make ropes,
   fishing nets, bags, clothes. This fiber is resistant to rot and damage
   and was therefore in use on sail- ships in the earlier centuries. The
   stems are used as poles for fences, corrals, and rural housing. The fat
   extracted from the seeds can also be used for soap-making. The fruit
   can be utilized against the eye disease xerophthalmia (also called
   ophthalmoxerosis) of which the deficiency of vitamin A is the main
   reason. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Adquiere, Awarra,
   Fiber palm. FURTHER INF: Found in the rainforest of the Amazon and the
   savannas of Suriname on flat to gently rolling terrain. Occurrence
   abundant, especially in disturbed sites. Seedlings require some shade
   and larger palms thrives in full sun.
