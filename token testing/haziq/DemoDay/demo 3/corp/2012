   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A hardy grass, ascendant or creeping extensively by means
   of branched rhizomes. Culms rising 6-40 cm in height, much branched
   from numerous nodes, the branches trailing, producing flowering stems
   or fin-shaped tufts of leaves. USE: Natural swards, turf, erosion
   control, silage, pasture or soil conservation groundcover under trees,
   or near the sea exposed to salt spray.. KILLING T: It survives frost.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing spring, summer and autumn. It may
   take 150-180 to form a complete ground cover. COMMON NAMES: St.
   Augustine grass. FURTHER INF: It can be found at elevations between sea
   level and 800 m, but it is primarily a coastal pioneer. Occurs in areas
   with annual rainfall from 750 mm to more than 2000 mm and grow best at
   temperatures between 20-30°C, a minimum of 10ºC. While moderately
   drought tolerant, it prefers good moisture, and can withstand temporary
   flooding and waterlogging. It is quite shade tolerant maintaining
   yields down to 40% sunlight. It is commonly found in moist swampy soils
   near the sea-shore in the United States and southern Africa. Occurs on
   well or poorly drained soils, from sandy loams to light clays but is
   also well adapted to steep sandy soils. Found in infertile to
   moderately fertile soils with pH from 5.0-8.5. Has good tolerance of
   soil salinity (to 15 dS/cm) and of wind-borne salt from the sea. Dry
   matter yields may be 2-6 t/ha.
