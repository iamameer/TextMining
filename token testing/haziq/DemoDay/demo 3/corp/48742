   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an herbaceous plant which stores reserves in the
   root during the first growing season and produce a flowering stem
   120-180 cm in height and seed in the following summer. After the seed
   crop is produced the entire plant dies. The taproot is white and
   deep-penetrating. The root may be 15-20 cm thick and up to 60 cm long.
   Leaves are glabrous, ovate to cordate, dark green or reddish, up to 60
   cm tall, forming a rosette on the underground stem. USES: The root
   contains sucrose used as all-round food sweetener (sugar). Used in the
   production of yeast, industrial alcohol, alcoholic beverages, ethanol,
   chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Molasses and fibre residue from the
   roots is a rich source of minerals and sugar (50%) and is used for
   production of mixed cattle feeds. Fresh leaves and tops can be
   collected and used as livestock feed or ploughed back into the soil.
   They can either be ensiled or fed dried. Tops are good for cattle but
   poisonous for pigs and horses, as they contain 1% oxalic acid. GROWING
   PERIOD: Biennial, grown as an annual for sugar production and as
   biennial for seed production. COMMON NAMES: Sugar beet. FURTHER INF.:
   It can be grown on a wide range of soils but medium to slightly heavy
   well drained soils are best. An ideal soil would be a deep and
   homogenous loam or sandy loam with a high content of humus. Soil
   crusting and compaction may lead to poor germination and formation of
   deformed roots.
