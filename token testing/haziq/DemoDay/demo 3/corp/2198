   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized tree reaching 3-10 m or even
   up to 30 m in height, with a straight trunk, usually branched near the
   base. Leaves distichous, oblong-lanceolate, 19-25 x 4-10 cm, and fruits
   globose or ovoid drupe, 8-10 mm in diameter, yellowish-red to
   bluish-violet and juicy. USES The ripe fruit can be eaten raw or made
   into preserves, jams, jellies, sauce for fish, a refreshing drink or
   wine. It is also used in brandy and syrups. Young leaves are used to
   flavour fish and meat stew and both immature fruit and young leaves
   serve as substitutes for vinegar. Young leaves can be eaten in salads
   and cooked with rice. Bark and leaves have medicinal properties but can
   also be poisonous. The wood can be used for paper pulp. The tree can be
   used for reclamation of degraded and lang-lang infested areas and it
   can be planted as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Seedlings
   bear fruit 4-5 years after planting. The fruiting season lasts only two
   months. COMMON NAMES Bignay, Chinese laurel, Salamander tree,
   Antidesme, Buni, Wuni, Huni, Buneh, Paginga, Isip, Kho lien tu, Baa mao
   ruesee, Mamao dong, Mao chaang, Choi moi. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: A. rumphii, A. dallachyanum, Stilago bunius. Bignay occurs
   wild in the wetter parts on India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Malaysia. In
   the tropics, it can be found at elevations between sea level and 1000
   m. The tree is common in the early stages of secondary forest
   succession, invading marginal grassland, but attains optimal growth
   under partial shade. Annual fruit yields may be 250-400 kg per tree.
