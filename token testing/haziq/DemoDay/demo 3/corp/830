   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A bushy, upright herb reaching up to 3 m in height.
   It has a vigorous root system. The stiff branches have white hairs and
   trifoliate leaflets, which are up to 10 cm long. The flowers are white
   or pink and the pods are straight, hairy, pale green and up to 10 cm
   long. USES It is grown for gum production. The young tender pods can be
   eaten as vegetables and the seeds are used as livestock feed. The plant
   is also grown as a green manure or used as fodder. Seed flour is used
   to improve the strength of paper and stamps or in textile sizing and as
   a thickener in ice creams and salad dressings. A water-soluble natural
   resin is also obtained from the seeds and is used in the food, paper,
   mining and petroleum industries. GROWING PERIOD Annual. Green pods
   starts forming after 45-55 days and are generally harvested 50-90 days
   after sowing, seeds ripen after 90-160 days. COMMON NAMES Cluster bean,
   Guar, Cyamopse a Quatre Ailes, Bakuchi, Gavar, Gorakshaphalini, Gorani,
   Gorchikuda, Gori, Kayi, Guaru, Khurti, Gruar, Kothaverai, Kulti,
   Kuwara, Siam Bean, Vah, Vahkiphali, Kotaranga, Kottavarai, Pe-walee,
   Walee-pe, Mgwaru, Goor, Gouree, Guwara, Gawar, Guvar, Guara, Guvara,
   Gowaree. FURTHER INF Cluster bean may have originated from India and
   Pakistan. It can in the tropics be grown successfully from sea level to
   1000 m in elevation. Optimum yields is 45 t/ha of green fodder, or 6-9
   t/ha of green pods or 0.7-3 t/ha of seeds. A high level of rainfall and
   relative humidity at flowering time can seriously affect fertilization
   and pod development. It is fairly resistant to pests and diseases when
   grown in a drier climate, but may suffer from pests under more humid
   conditions.
