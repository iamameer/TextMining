   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A soft-wooded, prickly, subshrub growing up to 2 m
   tall. On open sites it is branched and spreading, while in crowded
   stands it is tall and straight. USES It is grown for fiber, fodder,
   fuel, and green manure. Stems provide a strong, lasting fiber used for
   fishnet cordage and salicloth. Leaves can be used as forage and poultry
   feed. The seeds are edible and used as a food source in times of
   famine. The plant can also be used for paper production. It is
   mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD
   Fast-growing annual, growing 60-100 days for fodder, 150-170 days for
   mature seeds, and about 180 for fuel. In the tropics two harvests may
   be obtained per year. In India the seeds are sown in June-July, and the
   crop is ready to cut in September-October. COMMON NAMES Danicha,
   Prickly sesban, Canicha, Jantar, Dunchi fiber. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonyms: S. aculeata, S. cannabina, Coronilla cannabina. Danicha can
   be found at elevations between sea level and 1200 m. The plant grows
   fast, seeds freely, and reportedly can become a noxious weed in rice
   paddies and in maize. The species is probably indigenous to the Indian
   subcontinent. The plant is nitrogen fixing. Seed yields may be 600-1000
