   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall semi-deciduous tree usually up to about 30 m
   in height but one specimen have been measured to 59 m. The trunk may
   reach a diameter of 200-260 cm. The boles are moderately buttressed at
   the base and the trunk is often irregular. The crown is open and the
   leaves semi-transparent in the sunlight. Heartwood light grey-brown,
   very durable, and resistant to termites, grain somewhat interlocked and
   soft. USES The wood is easy to work, somewhat oily and hence difficult
   to glu, tends to rust nails and is very slow drying. It is excellent
   for templates, pattern making, carving and turnery. Also used for
   indoor joinery, flooring, cabinet and carriage work, planking of boat
   hulls, and in making food processing equipment. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES White beech. FURTHER INF White beech can be
   found at elevations between sea level and 500 m. Its latitudinal range
   in Australia is 19.5-35.5Â°S. It can grow on a wide range of sites from
   near creek banks to the side of mountains.
