   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a perennial or annual grass reaching 1-1.5 m in
   height in shallow water but is smaller on land. USE: The seed is
   edible, it has a mild flavour and can be ground into flour and used as
   a cereal. The seed is very small but is easily harvested. It does then
   have to be separated from its husk, which is a very fiddly operation.
   The plant is used for making bedding and pillows. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial or annual. COMMON NAMES: Slough grass, American slough grass.
   FURTHER INF: It grows in wet soils, meadows, swamps, marshes and very
   shallow water. It requires moist or wet soil and can grow in shallow
   water also if it is quite saline. It is not very particular to soil
   type and can grow in both fine and medium textured soils. It can be
   found in southern and eastern Europe to central Asia and in western and
   northern United States from California to Alaska.
