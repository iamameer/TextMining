   herbaceous plant 0.7-2 m tall. There are many varieties of tomatoes
   with red or yellow fruits of different size and shape. USES Tomatoes
   are grown for there edible fruits. The tomatoes are eaten cooked or
   raw, in a variety of ways. The fruit are used to produce soup, juice,
   sauce, ketchup, puree, paste, and powder. The are often canned and
   green, unribe tomatoes are pickled and preserved. Seeds contain 24% oil

   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: L. lycopersicum, Solanum lycopersicum.
   Tomato is probably native of Mexico. It can be grown at altitudes
   between sea level and 2000 m in the tropics, but yields are generally
   higher at elevations over 1000 m. A diurnal variation of at least 5-6Â°C
   is considered necessary for optimum development. High relative humidity
   can be harmfull to the tomato crop and fruits rarely ripen fully in wet
   and dull weather. On the other hand tomato is also sensitive to sunburn
   and hot dry winds can lead to flower drop and reduced yields. For many
   varieties trellising and tying to trellises increases yields and fruit
   quality. Yields are mainly between 20-40 t/ha bur yields up to 150 t/ha
   have been recorded.
