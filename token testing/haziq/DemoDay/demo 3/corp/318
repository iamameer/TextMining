   trees. USE: The seeds are roasted and eaten, they may require boiling
   to neutralize toxicity. Raw seeds are poisonous. Young leaves are eaten
   as a vegetable and also used as feed. The wood is used for bridge and
   household construction, flooring, paving blocks and vehicle bodies and
   also as fuel. Leaves bark and roots have medicinal properties. In
   Indonesia and Malaysia trees are planted for shade in coffee, clove and
   rubber plantations and are also extensively grown as an ornamental and

   agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: bead
   tree, circassian bean, circassian seed, coral wood, crab's eyes, jumbie

   southeast China and India. The tree has been introduced throughout the
   humid tropics. It has become naturalized in Malaysia, western and
   eastern Africa, and most island nations of both the Pacific and the
   Caribbean. It is a secondary forest tree favouring precipitation. Trees
   are found scattered in primary and secondary, evergreen to dry
   deciduous rainforests, but also in open savannah. The tree is
   susceptible to breakage in high winds, with most of the damage
   occurring in the crown. It is found on a variety of soils from deep,
   well-drained to shallow and rocky.
