   Ecocrop code 6779

   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A dioecious herbaceous vine reaching a height of up to 6
   m. USES: The cones are dried and used in the brewing of beer. Remnants
   of the dried, boiled cones are used as fertilizer. An essential oil
   from cones and flowers is used in perfumery. Parts of the plant have
   various medicinal properties and young leaves and shoots can be eaten
   as vegetables. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial climber, above ground organs
   die back every year at the onset of the cold period. COMMON NAMES:
   Hops, Chmel, Houblom, Hopfen, Hmelj. FURTHER INF Hops is probably
   native of Central Asia. It is a very latitude sensitive plant and a
   major factor concerning its economic performance as a commercial crop
   is the length of daylight hours, especially during the flowering
   period. In order to flower successfully the hop plant must, at a
   certain stage of its growth (usually expressed as a minimum height) be
   subject to specific hours of daylight (and darkness, which must be
   continuous). A cultivated hop of high quality requires a mean value of
   solar irradiation of 1800-2000 hours per year including 1300-1500 hours
   during the vegetative period. The plant require adequate shelter.
