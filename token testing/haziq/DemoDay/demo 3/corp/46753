   height, but reaching 20 m in some areas, with a dense erect canopy.
   Bark smooth and grey on young branches but on older ones. USE: The

   extracted from the bark, which also has medicinal properties. The tree
   is planted for shade, as an ornamnetal and it makes an attractive dense
   hedge. The tree is nitrogen fixing and the foliage can be used for
   green manure and mulch. It can be intercropped for shade in coffee,
   banana and cocoa plantations. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   pepperbark tree. FURTHER INF: Habitat ranges from evergreen mountain
   forest to evergreen sandveld forest along the coast, also found in
   secondary bushland, wooded ravines and in grasslands. It is moderately
   drought resistant and not suitable for areas that experience frost.
