   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Fast-growing perennial deciduous tree. USES: Chinese
   tallow tree is cultivated for its seeds as a source of vegetable
   tallow, a drying oil and protein food, and as an ornamental. Fruits
   yield two types of fats: outer covering of seeds contain a solid fat
   with low iodine value, known as Chinese Vegetable Tallow; kernels
   produce a drying oil with high iodine value, called Stillingia Oil.
   Tallow is used for manufacturing candles, a layer of wax being placed
   over the tallow body to prevent too rapid burning; has excellent
   burning quality, and gives an inodorous clear bright flame; also used
   for making soap, cloth dressing and fuel. KILLING T.: In the dormant
   state the tree may be frost resitant down to -10°C for brief spells.
   COMMON NAMES: Chinese tallow tree, Tallow tree, Chinese vegetable
   tallow tree, Soap tree, Popcorn tree, Pau de sebo, Tarcharbi shishum,
   Pahari shishum, Arbol de la cera. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms:
   Triadica sebifera, Excoecaria sebifera, Vilayati shisham, Stillingia
   sebifera, Croton sebiferums. Found at elevations between sea level and
   2000 m. Can reach a height of 12 m. The species is indigenous to
   subtropical areas of central South China. Usually occurring at
   latitudes below 32°N. Optimum annual wood production is 26 m3/ha, on
   coppice rotations of 4 years. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry
   species. The tree can be an aggressive weed, the seeds are spread
   widely by birds, and once established it is very difficult to
   eliminate. The sap (latex) is a powerful irritant that blisters the
   skin.
