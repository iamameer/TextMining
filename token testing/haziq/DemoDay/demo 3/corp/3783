   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 9-15 m in height with a
   light, spreading crown and somewhat drooping branches. It usually has a
   short bole, 3-5 m in length, sometimes longer if grown in a fully
   stocked forest. Bark is very thin, greyish-green, ashy or reddish
   peeling off in thin, papery flakes. USE: Leaves used as fodder, wood as
   firewood, charcoal, pulp for paper production and low quality timber.
   The tree yields a yellowish-green gum-oleoresin used as a diaphoretic
   and astringent. Used as host for lac insects. Planted for revegetation
   of poor soils and as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. In India
   the flowers appear from February to April, leaves appear in May-June,
   fruits ripen in May-June, and the leaves fall from December. COMMON
   NAMES: Indian olibanum tree. FURTHER INF: It can be found in tropical
   dry deciduous forests and occurs in very dry teak forests or in dry
   mixed deciduous forests. It is characteristically found on the slopes
   and ridges of hills, as well as on flat terrain, attaining a larger
   size on fertile soils. It is resistant to drought and fire. The tree is
   also frost hardy and serves as a nurse tree for other species. It
   typically grows on rocky ridges and it does well on neutral soils above
   gneiss, schist, quartzite, limestone and sandstone. The species has the
   ability to thrive in the poorest and the shallowest soils where most of
   its associates remain stunted. Relative humidity should be 40-80% in
   the winter and 60-90% in the summer. The tree can be found up to 1150 m
   in elevation.
