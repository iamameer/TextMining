   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, dense, evergreen tree normally reaching a
   height of 4-12 m, while up to 20 m have been recorded. The fruits are
   borne in loose clusters of 3-20, they are round or ovate, 2.5 cm long,
   and the peel is yellow to red and leathery. USES The fruits are eaten
   fresh, canned in syrup, dried or processed into juice and wine. It is a
   good source of honey. The fruit, its peel and seed have medicinal
   properties. The timber is very durable. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species. KILLING T Tender shoots and young trees may
   tolerate -1 to -2°C and mature trees -4°C or even -6°C for a few hours
   in the resting stage. GROWING PERIOD Perennial evergreen tree, it come
   into bearing in 4-6 years and require 98-106 days from bloom to
   harvest. COMMON NAMES Litchi nut, Litchi, Lychee, Linche, Lici, Licy,
   Litchibaum, Lichia, Litchi de Chine, Cerisier de la Chine, Mamoncillo
   chino, Klengkeng, Kalengkeng, Kelengkang, Letsias, Laici, Kyet-mouk,
   Lin chi, Lam yai, Kuleen, Ngeew, See raaman, Vai, Cay vai, Tu hu.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Nephelium litchi. Litchi nut is a
   native of Southern China. It is adapted to the tropics and warm
   subtropics within the latitudinal ranges 13-32°N and 9-29°S. It need a
   chilling period for flowering with temperatures about 7-12°C or below
   20-22°C depending on the cultivar. Widely flucturating day temperatures
   seem to contribute to vigorous vegetative growth. Bright light is
   essential for fruit production but shady conditions for young plants
   favour initial growth. It is sensitive to nitrogen and
   over-fertilization will slow growth and may be fatal to newly planted
   trees. The tree is sensitive to high winds especially in combination
   with low relative humidity, and it does not thrive in hot dry summers.
   Optimum relative humidity of wettest month is 83% and driest month 70%.
   In Swaziland lychee can be found at elevations between 1000-2000 m,
   while in southern China, it can be grown from sea level with an optimum
   elevation of about 300 m. Photosynthesis pathway probably C 3. Fruit
   yields for 10-year-old trees range from 10-80 kg/tree, or 0.7-11.2
   t/ha. Average yields are often only about 2 t/ha.
