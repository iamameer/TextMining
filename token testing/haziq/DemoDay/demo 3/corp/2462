   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A slender, evergreen tree, 10-20 m tall, conical when
   young, later becomming cylindrical, in cultivation usually smaller than
   when found growing wild. Root system dense and close to the surface.
   Leaves obovate-oblong to elliptic, 6-13 x 3-6 cm. The flower buds 1-2
   cm long and the fruit a berry, 2-2.5 cm long and dark red. USES The
   clove (the flower bud) is used as a spice and in the production of
   'kretek' cigarettes, which are smoked in Indonesia. When used as a
   spice, the dried cloves are added to the food as such or after
   grinding, or the oleoresin is extracted to standardize the flavor. The
   clove and the mother of clove (the fruit) are used for there medicinal
   properties. Distillation of cloves yields an oil that is used in the
   flavouring and perfume industry. A lesser quality oil is distilled from
   the flower stalks and from the leaves. A major componet of this oil is
   phenol eugenol, used in soaps, detergents, toothpaste and
   pharmaceutical products. The timber is hard heavy and durable, but has
   a dull greyish colour. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. First harvest may be
   taken after 6-9 years, the tree come into full bearing after 20 years
   and it has an economical life of 60-100 years. COMMON NAMES Clove, Clou
   de girafle, Giroflier, Clou de girofle, Cravoda India, Clavero girofle,
   Cenkeh, Lay-hnyin, Khan phluu, Kaanz phuu, Kan phlu, Dinh huong,
   Karanfal, Benefundi, Kanumfari, Karanho, Kade, Osaragbogo-eze, Karafwu,
   Konofuru. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms; E. caryophyllus, E.
   caryophyllata, Syzygium aromaticum, Caryophyllus aromaticus, Jambosa
   caryophyllus. Clove is probably native of the Moluccas in eastern
   Indonesia. It thrive best in the tropics in insular, maritime climates
   at altitudes from sea level to 300-600 m, but be found at elevations up
   to 900 m. A climate with a marked dry season promotes flowering, but
   the tree does not cope well with water stress. Cloves for 'kretek'
   cigarette production are said to require 3 months with less than 60 mm
   rainfall each, while cloves to be used as spice, should have no months
   with less than 80 mm of rainfall. Some drier weather is desirable for
   harvesting and drying of the crop. It is often planted on sloping land
   to ensure good drainage. Shade in the early stages are desirable. High
   winds can be harmfull. Each tree may yield about 1-12 kg of cloves per
   year and the production is variable. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry
   species.
