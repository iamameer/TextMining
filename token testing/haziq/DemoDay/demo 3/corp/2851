   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a hardy, ferny-leafed spreading herbaceous legume
   with a woody tap-root. USE: Very palatable and is grazed selectively by
   cattle, sheep and marsupials. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. While its main
   growth is during summer, it can grow well during the cooler months and
   tolerate mild frosts. Plants develop slowly and may take several years
   to reach maximum size. COMMON NAMES: Joint vetch, Turi rawa,
   Torog-torog. FURTHER INF: It is native to the high altitude tropical
   and low altitude subtropical parts of South America between Equator and
   45Â°S. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 1800 m. It
   will persist on infertile, well-drained soil, but not on heavy
   waterlogged clays. It can respond to superphosphate. It can grow with
   sod-forming grasses such as mat grass, bahia and blue couch, tolerating
   heavy grazing through its prostrate stems, but can also climb when
   supported by taller grasses. Tolerates mild frosts.
