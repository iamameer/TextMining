   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is needle leaf, evergreen tree reaching up to 20 m in
   height. Bark brown, broken into scaly plates with resin-filled pockets.
   Leaves dark green, linear, sessile, spiral in origin, but twisted at
   base to form two ranks, persisting many years. Mature cones nearly
   cylindrical, 3ˆ8.5 cm long by 2ˆ3 cm thick, dark purple when growing.
   USE: The wood is light in weight, relatively soft, low in shock
   resistance and has good splitting resistance, it is primarily used as
   pulpwood, lumber and firewood. Minor uses include paneling, crates, and
   other products not requiring high structural strength. The tree
   provides food or cover for some animals and both food and cover for
   others. Oleoresin from the bark is used as a medium for mounting
   microscopic specimens and as a cement for various parts of optical
   systems. It is also used in the manufacture of medicinal compounds and
   spirit varnishes. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Balsam fir.
   FURTHER INF: It grows best in the eastern part of its range in
   south-eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States. This area is
   characterized by cool temperatures and abundant moisture. It grows on a
   wide range of inorganic and organic soils originating from glaciation
   and generally falling within the acid Spodosol, Inceptisol, and
   Histosol soil orders. These are characterized by a thick mor humus and
   a well-defined A2 horizon, usually gray in appearance because of
   leaching, and commonly caused by abundant rainfall, cool climate, and
   coniferous cover. Many of the glacial till soils in New England are
   shallow and have a compact layer about 46 cm below the surface.
