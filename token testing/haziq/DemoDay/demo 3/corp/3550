   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deep-rooted, fast-growing, native perennial shrub
   reaching from a few centimetres up to 3 m in height. Plants are
   deciduous in desert ecotypes but tend to be evergreen elsewhere. USE:
   The twigs and foliage provide forage for livestock and wildlife. The
   seeds are consumed by small mammals and birds. The plant have been used
   for erosion control and revegetaion. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Quail bush, Big saltbrush. FURTHER INF: Quail bush is native of
   south-western United States. It can be found at elevations between sea
   level and 1400 m. It is found in both coastal and desert habitats.
   Coastal populations typically occur at the base of coastal bluffs and
   on coastal floodplains. Interior populations are found along valley
   bottoms and margins of dry lakebeds, where groundwater of moderate
   salinity is available. Photosynthesis pathway C4. Atriplex shrubs
   harbor spinach mildew and consequently should not be planted where
   spinach is grown.
