   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen, spreading tree up to 20 m tall with a
   single bare stem and a dense, roundish to mushroom-shaped crown. Leaves
   alternate, simple, elliptic to oblong, 3-8 x 2-4 cm, leathery, dark
   green. Fruit oval to round, up to 5 x 3.5 cm, russet-yellow to greyish,
   scaly and pitted, becoming orange-yellow when ripe. USE: the fruit is
   adible and has a high content of protein and vitamin C. Seeds are
   pounded and used for making soup, they can also be eaten and make a
   passable substitute for almonds. Fruits and leaves are used as feed and
   the flowers are a source of honey. Wood is used as timber and fuel. The
   bark contains tannin and the seeds have a high content of lipids. A hot
   fomentation of the bark is used in the treatment of pneumonia. A leaf
   decoction is either drunk or used in a bath as a fever remedy. Crushed
   or pulped leaves are used in a dressing for fractures or dislocations,
   and for wounds, sores and cuts. The tree is planted for shade and as an
   ornamental. The oil cake can be used as manure. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Fever tree, hissing tree, mobola plum. FURTHER
   INF: It grows naturally in open, deciduous woodland, wooded grassland
   and upland grassland, often persisting in cultivated land and present
   in secondary bushland. It is particularly common near rivers and in
   areas of poor drainage. It is sensitive to frost and cold wind. It can
   tolerate small concentrations of copper in the soil. Often found on
   light yellowish-brown to reddish-yellow, gritty, sandy clay loams and
   red to dark red friable clays with lateritic horizon.
