   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A freely tillering cultivated grass and cereal crop
   reaching a height of 50-100 cm. As with wheat and oats, barley also
   presents two types of root systems. In the first, the seedling roots
   develop from germination to the tillering stage; in the second, which
   starts at tillering, the secondary crown roots, or adventitious roots,
   appear. These will serve to anchor the plant, and to provide it with
   water and nutrients. The depth they reach will depend on the hydric
   condition of the soil, its texture and structure, external and internal
   temperatures, and on the genetic make up of the variety. The stems of
   the barley plant are erect and made up of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical
   internodes or joints, separated by the nodes, which bear the leaves. As
   in all Gramineae, the leaves are placed opposite their neighbours along
   the stem. The leaves are linear lanceolate and formed of sheath, blade,
   auricles and ligule. The sheaths surround the stem completely. The
   ligule, and especially the auricles, distinguish barley from other
   cereal grains: they are glabrous, envelop the stem and can be pigment
   with anthocyanins. Flowers-spikes: the last internode of the stem
   extends as a rachis, which bears the spicules alternating on its nodes.
   Spikes of distich barleys do not have a terminal spicule as do those of
   wheat. Spikes can be awned, mutic (blunt) or hooded, and also can be
   smooth or toothed. The spikes can have two or six rows of grain,
   depending on the fertility of the lateral spikes. The rachis has 10 to
   30 nodes, so the ears of six-row barleys can have from 25 up to 60
   grains, and two-row barleys 25 to 30. The fruit is an oval, ridged
   caryopsis with rounded ends. The spike may be long or short, according
   to the plant type, but it always has several glumes with filiform awns
   that may diverge. Seeds are generally covered, with the palea and the
   lemma adhered to them, or can be open. Grains can be white in colour,
   blue, black, etc. Barley is predominantly autogamous. USES: In the
   traditional areas, most barley is use for animal feed (half of the
   world's barley production). In the non-traditional areas, barley's
   principal use is as food, followed by animal feed and use as raw
   material for the malting industry. Pearl barley (used in soups, or fed
   to live stock) is the decorticated caryopsis, while barley that is
   allowed to germinate and is then dehydrated is called malt. A very
   nourishing drink made from the latter can be used as a substitute for
   coffee. Barley is also used commercially in the making of beer and
   whiskey. The cereal is prepared for eating by boiling or parching the
   whole grain. It can then be ground for gruel or made into flour for
   baking. Barley can also be grown as a hay crop. The caryopsis is used
   to prepare decoctions and fluid extract. It has nutritive, emollient
   and anticatarrhal properties. KILLING T.: The main climatic mishap is
   frost damage to the seedlings, when the death of many plants can
   drastically thin out the crop. At the seedling stage, barley is more
   susceptible to freezing conditions than wheat. The minimum temperature
   for germination occurs between 3-4°C, the optimal temperature being
   about 20°C, and the maximum temperature between 28-30°C. GROWING
   PERIOD: Annual grass, can be harvested after 90-120 days for spring
   varieties, and after 180-240 days for winter varieties. COMMON NAMES:
   barley, food barley, feed barley, malting barley, orge, cebada, gerste,
   gebs, garbu, segem, schair, sheko, bongo. FURTHER INF.: Scientific
   synonym: H. sativum. Barley is grown from 70°N in Europe to arid
   regions near the Sahara and up to 4700 m in elevation in the Himalayas.
   In the tropics, the plant can normally only be successfully grown at
   elevations above 1800 m and in moderate to low humidity.
   Geographically, barley is the most widely distributed of all cereal
   crops. The crop is cultivated from Alten in Norway (70º N), inside the
   Arctic Circle, to tropical Timbuktu in Mali at around 17ºN. In the
   Americas, it is grown from latitude 65ºN in Alaska Nilan, 1964 to 53ºS
   in southern Chile. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 I. Yields in the
   United States vary between 1-5 t/ha while the average yields in Africa
   are about 1.2 t/ha. Heavy impermeable soils and light acid soils are
   unsuitable for barley.
