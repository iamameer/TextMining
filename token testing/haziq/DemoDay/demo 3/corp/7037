   than 2.5 m but may reach 6 m in height. USES It is suitable for
   reclaiming of waste land. The wood can be used as firewood, charcoal,
   and gunpowder charcoal. Leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots have
   medicinal properties. Extracts of the leaves also serves as
   insecticides, fungicides, fish poison and as antiseptics. The leaves
   yield a yellow dye. It is mentioned as a possible agroforestry species.
   KILLING T The shrub is killed to the ground by frost but it recovers
   rapidly. GROWING PERIOD Perennial evergreen shrub. (GMIN estimated by
   the compiler). COMMON NAMES Malabar nut, Vasaka, Adhatoda, Adsa,
   Arusha, Bakas, Adadodai, Adulsa, Adusa, Adathoda. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: A. zeylanica, Justica adhatoda. In the Himalayas,
   the shrub can be found at elevations between sea level and 1300 m. It
   can be found on a variety of sites from moist river banks to dry slopes
   and disturbed areas. Since it is unpalatable to livestock and has the
   ability to colonize waste places and disturbed areas, this plant may
   become a pest when introduced to new areas.
