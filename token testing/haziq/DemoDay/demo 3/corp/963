   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized to tall, buttressed evergreen tree
   usually reaching up to 12 m in orchards and up to 25-40 m in the
   forest. The crown is conical and leaves simple, 8-20 cm long. The fruit
   is ovoid to ellipsoid with hard, conical projections on the surface,
   5-30 cm long and 1.5-8 kg in weight, with a dull green to light
   yellowish green surface and with a strong odor. USES The fruit pulp is
   eaten fresh, cooked as a vegetable or in soups, made into a sauce, or
   processed into various products. It can be frozen, dried, fermented,
   salted or dried and boild with sugar. The pulp is a source of
   carbohydrates, and vitamins B and C. The seeds are eaten dried,
   roasted, fried in coconut oil, or boiled, and used in confections.
   Seeds are rich in proteins and carbohydrates. The rind of the fruit is
   dried and used as fuel. Several parts of the tree have medicinal
   properties. The light wood is not durable, but is used for indoor
   constructions and cheaper types of furniture. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Seedlings fruit after
   about 7-12 years and grafted trees after 4-5 years. The fruit takes 3
   months to ripe. There may be two crops per year for 50 years. COMMON
   NAMES Durian, Dourian, Durion, Duren, Dulian, Du-yin, Herisson d'arbre,
   Durione, Civet fruit, Thurian, Thu-rian kaek, Thu-reen, Thourien,
   Ambetan, Kadu, Rian, Sau rieng. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: D.
   acuminatissima. Durian is a native of south-eastern Asia, particularly
   Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. It is strictly tropical and can be grown
   within the latitudinal range 18°N-S. It performs best at elevations
   between sea level and 800 m. In Malaysia and Thailand it is usually
   grown below 300 m. It needs shade when young. The tree is adapted to
   warm and humid growing conditions but it can tolerate 2-3 dry months.
   Short relatively dry spells may stimulate flowering. A sheltered site
   is desirable to prevent branches laden with fruit from breaking in the
   wind. Heavy soils may lead to root rot. Up to 50-100 fruits per tree
   per year or a yield of 10-18 t/ha can be expected from a good orchard.
   Average yields are, however, often only 3-8 t/ha.
