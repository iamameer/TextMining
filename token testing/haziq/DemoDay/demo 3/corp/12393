   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous plant with stems ascending to erect
   reaching 30-120 cm in height. Leaves opposite with 5-15 cm long blades.
   Flower fragrant, small, corolla cylindric to urn-shaped, 5-lobed. The
   seed pod (follicle) slender, cylindric, pointed, shaped like a smooth,
   curved green bean, generally longer than 12 cm. A thick milky,
   poisonous juice exudes from any broken portion of the plant. USE: The
   flowers are a source of honey. Fibres are extracted from the inner
   layer of the bark. The fibre is excellent for making fishing lines and
   nets because it keeps its strength under water and does not shrink. It
   can also be used in the manufacture of deer nets, slings for hunting
   small game, nooses for snaring grouse and other game birds, hide
   stretchers, moccasins, clothing, woven bedding for baby cradles, wheels
   used in a type of dart game, tump lines and cat-tail mats. For making
   garments, the fibre was sometimes mixed with deer hair before spinning,
   Although this plant is considered toxic to humans (and the bane of
   dogs), the roots were commonly harvested in the 19th and early 20th
   centuries for a variety of folk medicine and medical purposes. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Indian hemp. FURTHER INF: In parts of
   the United States it is listed as a noxious weed. Found in cultivated
   fields, pastures, rangeland, open woods, fencerows, roadsides, dry
   rocky or open woods, glades and prairies. It can be found growing in
   moist or shady places and is easily cultivated in average, dry to
   medium wet, well-drained soil. It prefers sandy soil but will grow in
   most soils in sun or light shade.
