   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect, smooth or slightly hairy branched annual, reaching
   a height of 0.9-1.6 m, small white flowers in compound umbels,
   greyish-brown aromatic seeds.
   USE: Dried and mature fruits and seed are used for extraction of oil.
   The oil, both pure and dethymolized, is employed as an antiseptic and
   aromatic carminative. It is occasionally used for perfuming fragrant
   soaps and as an insecticide. It has medicinal properties and is much
   valued for its antispasmodic, stimulant, tonic and carminative
   properties. The fruit is used as a spice in curries.
   GROWING PERIOD
   Annual herb, flowering after 90-120 days after sowing and ready for
   harvest after 150-180 days.

   Ammi, Bishop's weed, True bishop's weed, weed-seed, Ethiopian caraway,
   Ajowan, Omam, Omum, Netch-azmud, Azmud-addi, Kamon, Kamuni, Azmud,
   Camun, Gummur-hurtui.
   FURTHER INF
