   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A hebaceous plant reaching up to 1 m with a short
   stem and 6-10 tufted leaves, 7-8 cm x 30-50 cm. It has primary ovate or
   pear shaped rhizomes, 5-8 cm x 1-5 cm and secondary finger shaped
   rhizomes, with an inner yellow colour and a characteristic odor and
   slightly bitter taste. USES The cured and dried rhizome produce an
   aromatic yellow-orange powder that is used as a spice, as a coloring
   agent and for the preparation of solvent-extracted oleoresin. As a
   spice it is used in rice, curry powder, and in processed foods and
   sauces. As a colour it is used as a textile dye and as a coloring agent
   in pharmacies, confectionery and food industries. The oleoresin is used
   in processed food and it also has medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. In India the crop is best planted in April-May. Leaves
   appear above ground in about 30 days, and the crop is harvested when
   the leaves wither after 270-365 days. COMMON NAMES Turmeric, Curcuma,
   Safran des Indes. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: C. longa. Turmeric is
   believed to have been domesticated in South or Southeast Asia. It can
   be grown at elevations between sea level and 2000 m in the Himalayan
   foothills. It requires a hot and moist climate. Yields of fresh raw
   turmeric usually vary between 7-9 t/ha when turmeric is grown as a
   rain-fed crop and between 17-25 t/ha when it is grown under irrigation,
   but yields up to 50 t/ha can be obtained. Dried spice yields vary
   between 0.4-1.7 t/ha. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
