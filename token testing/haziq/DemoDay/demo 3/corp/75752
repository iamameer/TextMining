   DESCRIPTION: A tree with a long trunk or shrub, rather sparse branches
   and a rounded top. The bark is furrowed and flaky, dry and grey. The
   leaves are long and narrow, silvery grey with very fine parallel veins.
   The flowers are yellow and wattle-like. USE: It is eaten fairly readily
   by sheep, but is reported to cause impaction after about six weeks of
   continuous feeding. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Broad-leaf
   Nealie, Boree. FURTHER INF: It is common in north-west corner of New
   South Wales, to the north-west of the Paroo River and Menindee, and
   with isolated occurrences in the north-western plains, also south-west,
   central and north-eastern Queensland and extends southward along the
   Grey Range, mainly on pebbly clay soils on the edges of the Mitchell
   grass country. Grows in mulga and Casuarina open woodlands on sand
   hills, or as scattered trees forming an open shrubland, and along water
   courses on gibber plains.
