   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen shrub or medium-sized tree, up to 20 m
   tall with dense crown. Bark greyish. Leaves alternate, simple, 7-23 x
   5-16 cm. Flowers pale yellow with dark purple centre. USE: Young flower
   buds and leaves are edible and leaves are also used as fodder. The bark
   yields fibre and wood is used for smaller implements. Wood, fruits and
   flowers yields dye and the bark tannin. The heartwood has a healing
   property useful in treating pleurisy and cholera, colic and high
   fevers; it is carminative. The cooked fruit crushed in coconut oil
   provides a salve, which, if applied to the hair, will kill lice. The
   sap of the leaves and decoctions of most parts of the plant are used
   externally to treat various skin diseases. Juices from the pounded
   fruits mixed with pounded leaves are ingredients of a poultice to treat
   headaches and itches. A decoction of the astringent bark is used to
   treat dysentery and haemorrhoids, and a maceration of it is drunk for
   colds. The fruit contains an antibiotic and the juice is used to treat
   herpes. Other extracts of the plant have significant antimalarial
   activity. Leaf and bark decoctions are taken for high blood pressure.
   Leaf tea is taken for rheumatism and urinary retention. Seeds are
   purgative. The tree is used for erosion control under saline conditions
   and planted as an ornamental. Wood chips and leaves are used as green
   manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Indian tulip tree.
   FURTHER INF: It is pantropic along sandy sea coasts. The species can
   also be found on rocky coasts such as in Malaysia. It is only sparingly
   found on the inland edge of mangrove of persisting from cultivation. It
   is a suitable tree for dry locations and is highly tolerant of saline
   conditions. Soils are sandy, slightly alkaline and poor in nutrients.
