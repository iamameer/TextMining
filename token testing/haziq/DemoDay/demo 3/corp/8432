   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree reaching 20-40 m in height and about 6 m in
   girth. It has a characteristic low branching habit and an open crown,
   which allows substantial light under its canopy. The compound leaves
   are usually about 20-45 cm long and have 10-12 pairs of stout opposite
   pinnae. The pods are 40-50 cm long and 5-10 cm wide. USE: the seeds are
   edible, dried pods are used as fuel and wood is used as firewood and
   charcoal. The seed is a source of edible oil, 'the oil bean'. Crushed
   seeds taken in case of abortion; leaf and stem decoctions are taken
   against diarrhoea. The trees fix atmospheric nitrogen and the leaves
   are used as manure. The tree is also planted as an ornamental and
   farmers protect this species on farms because of its open crown form
   that allows substantial light and does not inhibit crop plants grown
   under its canopy. This accounts for the trees use in combination with
   food crops on farms and particularly in home gardens in south east
   Nigeria. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Oil-bean trees produce beans from
   their 10th year and will continue to bear regularly. COMMON NAMES: Oil
   bean tree, Owala oil tree, Atta bean. FURTHER INF: It occurs from
   Senegal to Angola and also to the Islands of Principe and Sao Tome.
   This multipurpose tree is endemic to the humid and some parts of the
   sub-humid zones of West Africa. It is more common in the rain forest
   but individuals are found elsewhere in the high forest zone. Often it
   occurs near the streams and on the edges of damp depressions and
   frequently seen as a small tree of untidy habit and large crown on
   roadsides and farms. In such places it is usually a relic, having been
   left on account of its hard wood.
