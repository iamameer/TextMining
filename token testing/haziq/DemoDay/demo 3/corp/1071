   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall deciduous shrub or small tree reaching a
   height of about 10 m. USES The fruit is eaten fresh, dried, in
   confectionery, brewed as an alcoholic beverage or used as a laxative.
   The fruit is a source of calcium, sugar, iron, copper, carbohydrates,
   potassium, and vitamin A. The leaves are used as potherbs or fed to
   livestock. The tree is also grown for shade. KILLING T Dormant mature
   trees may tolerate -12Â°C. GROWING PERIOD The fruiting cycle is 120-150
   days. Some varieties produce one crop per year, others two. Trees have
   been known to live as long as 200 years. COMMON NAMES Common fig,
   Adriatic fig, Symrna fig. FURTHER INF Common fig is native of western
   Asia. There are two primary types, the Adriatic fig which produces
   fruit without pollination and the Symrna fig that require the presents
   of a fig wasp for pollination. Fig thrives best in areas of moderate
   relative humidity and it does not do well in the low wet tropics, but
   can be grown at higher elevations in areas of low rainfall. It require
   some dry months particularly at the flowering and fruiting periods and
   it also require some winter chilling. It is very frequently grown on
   hillsides at altitudes up to 1200 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3.
