   Notes
   Habitat:
   It may be found near rivers, on established dunes and
   raised sandy plains of the deep Kalahari sands. Generally
   it is found in mixed open woodlands, and sometimes as
   dominant stands of large extent. Outside it's core area it
   appears only sporadically, or as a small isolated stand.
   Environment
   Latitude: It is found between 15-21°S.
   Altitude: It's core area is mainly in more upland
   areas, generally above 1200 metres, although it is found
   down to 200 metres.
   Temperature: It thrives with temperatures ranging
   from maybe -10ºC in winter to well over 38ºC in summer. -7°
   C may kill young plants. Reported temperature range for
   growth is 10-40°C with the optimum between 18-30°C.
   Water: It is a tree of seasonal drylands, surviving
   unreliable rains. Reported annual rainfall range for growth
   is 400-1000 mm with the optimum between 500-800 mm.
   Radiation
   Range & intensity: It thrives in full sunlight.
   Photoperiodism:
   Soil:
   Physical: It may be associated with alluvial soils
   near rivers, but most commonly with the deep Kalahari
   sands. It cannot tolerate areas subject to flooding.
   Chemical: It will not withstand saline soils.
   Estimated soil pH range for growth is 6-8.5 with the
   optimum between 6.5-8.
