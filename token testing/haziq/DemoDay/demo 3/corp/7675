   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A crooked shrub 1-2 m tall to a medium-sized tree
   reaching a height of up to 25 m. It has large greenish-cream, white,
   greenish yellow, red and crimson. USES The wood can be used as fuel and
   for charcoal, posts, and poles. The tree can be used as an ornamental
   in coastal areas, for shelter, and amenity plantings and it is a good
   source of pollen for bees. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
   Broad-leaved paperbark, Coarse-leaved paperbark, Swamp paperbark.
   FURTHER INF Broad-leaved paperbark occurs in northern Australia within
   the latitudinal range 8-26Â°S at elevations between sea level and 1000
   m. It is mainly found in lowland coastal marshes, seasonal swamps and
   esturine plains, but it can also occur on slopes and ridges in
   undulating country. Its free-seeding and suckering habit makes it a
   potential weed.
