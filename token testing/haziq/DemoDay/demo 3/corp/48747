   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Summer annual, coarse, erect with much variability in
   growth characteristics; culms solid or sometimes with spaces in pith,
   0.6ˆ5 m tall, depending on variety and growing conditions, 5 to over 30
   mm in diameter, either dry at maturity or with sweet insipid juice;
   leaves broad and coarse, similar in shape to those of corn but shorter
   and wider; blades glabrous and waxy; sheaths encircle culm and have
   overlapping margins; panicle erect, sometimes recurved, usually compact
   in most grain sorghums and more open in forage types; seed covered by
   glumes that may or may not be removed by threshing; prop roots may grow
   from culm nodes; bud at each node from which a tiller may grow; seeds
   white, yellow, red, or brown; panicle with up to 6,000 spikelets. Seeds
   25,000 to 61,740/kg. USES: Grown for grain, forage, syrup and sugar,
   and industrial uses of stems and fibers. Grain sorghum is a staple
   cereal in hot dry tropics, the threshed grain ground into a wholesome
   flour. Stalks used as animal feed. Important summer fodder where
   temperatures are high and rainfall insufficient for corn. Most
   important for silage or green soiling, or for hay when grown irrigated
   in very dry areas. FURTHER INF.: Ranging from Cool Temperate Steppe to
   Wet through Tropical Thorn to Wet Forest Life Zones, sorghum is
   reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 2.0 to 41.0 (mean of 86
   cases = 10.9), annual temperature of 7.8 to 27.8°C (mean of 86 cases =
   20.1), and pH of 4.3 to 8.7 (mean of 69 cases = 6.7). Adapted to
   tropical and subtropical summer rainfall climate with rainfall from
   25ˆ125 cm annually; of little importance in more humid areas with
   higher rainfall. Some cvs are short-day plants. Adapted to wide range
   of soils varying from light loams to heavy clays; thrives best on
   light, easily worked soils of high fertility, with moderate to high
   available water, with erosion not a problem. Moderately well-drained
   soils are suitable for sorghums. Small amounts of alkali in sand
   reduces performance considerably. Tolerance to salinity is moderate.
   Prefers moderately acid soil; pH down to 5.7 does not drastically
   affect production.
