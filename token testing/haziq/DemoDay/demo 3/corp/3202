   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An adaptable, persistent, bluish grass growing in large
   tufts up to 2 m high with a reed like habit. The root system may reach
   as deep as 80 cm. USES: Sown as permanent pasture it can be stocked
   heavily during the wet season (4-5 beasts/ha). Also cut for fresh feed
   and fodder. Used for reclaiming overgrazed and run-down areas, as a
   wind break and for erosion control. The thick stems are used for thatch
   in Africa. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Gamba grass.
   FURTHER INF: It is native of tropical Africa between latitudes
   15°N-25°S and occurs naturally in xerophytic grasslands on doleritic,
   sandy or clayey soils. It can be found from sea level up to 2000 m in
   elevation, best grown below 1000 m. It has been introduced into Brazil,
   India and Australia. It should be burned every year during the dry
   season. Can grow in environments with 400-3000 mm rainfall, and
   withstand a dry season of up to 9 months, but prefers more than 750 mm
   rainfall with 3-7 months dry season. Its root system provides excellent
   drought tolerance. Adapted to sands to clays with pH 4-7.5, infertile
   to fertile - but grows best on loams of moderate fertility. Good
   tolerance of high Al, but not salinity. It can tolerate some
   waterlogging. It has a critical photoperiod for flowering of 12-14
   hours. Flowering increases as day length shortened from 12 to eight
   hours. Dry matter yields are normally between 1-18 t/ha.
