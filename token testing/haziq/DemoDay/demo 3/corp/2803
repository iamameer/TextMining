   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a climbing, deciduous vine (liana). In the forests
   where it is native it sometimes climbs up to 15-30 m high into trees.
   It has a more delicate appearance than regular kiwifruit. The fruit is
   about 2-2.5 cm long and contain a number of small seeds. It is
   generally green, fuzzless, and the size of grapes. Cut open, it looks
   much like regular kiwifruit with its small black seeds, emerald green
   colour, and typical rayed pattern. USE: The fruit can be eaten raw,
   cooked or dried and the plant can be grown as an ornamental shade plant
   on a pergola. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Hardy kiwi,
   Bower vine, Dessert kiwi, Cocktail kiwi. FURTHER INF: It is native to
   northern China, Korea, Siberia and possibly Japan. The plants need a
   long growing season (about 150 frost-free days) which will not be
   hampered by late winter or early autumn freezes. When fully dormant,
   they can withstand temperatures to about -30°C. Some cultivars are said
   to tolerate temperatures down to about -50°C when fully dormant.
   However they must acclimate to cold slowly and any sudden plunge in
   temperature may cause trunk splitting and subsequent damage to the
   vine. It needs a period of winter chilling but late winter freezing
   temperatures will kill any exposed buds. It can grow in harsher
   climates than the kiwifruit. It will tolerate some shade but prefer a
   sunny location where it can ramble across some type of trellising
   system. Neutral soils are acceptable but the leaves may show nitrogen
   deficiency when the soils become too basic.
