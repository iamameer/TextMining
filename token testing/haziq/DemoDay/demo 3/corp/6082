   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is one of the largest deciduous thorn trees, reaching
   up to 30 m in height, with spreading branches and a rounded crown. Bark
   rough and dark brown, or smooth and greenish-grey. The roots can grow
   to 40 m deep. Leaves with 3-10 pairs of pinnae, each bearing 6-23 pairs
   of leaflets; leaflets quite large, 3.5-9 x 0.7-3 mm, grey-green.
   Flowers in slender, creamy white spikes, 4-14 cm long. USE: During the
   dry season, people eat the seeds. The leaves and pods are palatable to
   domestic animals and an important source of protein for livestock in
   the dry season. Wood is used for small implements and fuel. The use of
   bark and roots either externally or internally against respiratory
   infections, digestive disorders, malaria and other fevers is
   widespread. The bark is used to clean teeth, as it is believed to
   contain fluorine. An extract is used for toothache in humans and eye
   infections in livestock. The tree is planted for shade for coffee and
   livestock, to protect the banks of watercourses and as an ornamental.
   Branches lopped for fencing compounds and livestock enclosures. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: winter thorn. FURTHER INF: It grows on
   the banks of seasonal and perennial rivers and streams on
   coarse-textured, well-drained, sandy alluvial soils or on flat land. It
   thrives in climates characterized by long summers, or a dry season with
   long days. It tolerates seasonal waterlogging and salinity but cannot
   withstand heavy clayey soils.
