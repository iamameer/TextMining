   Common names braacatinga, bracatinga

   Ecocrop code 17796

   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree or shrub reaching 4-12 m or even 20 m in
   height, with a tall, straight, slender trunk 10-50 cm in diameter in
   forest, or short and branched, with dense rounded crown of grey
   foliage. Leaves pinnate, compound and small, with axis 3-11 cm long and
   3-9 pairs of pinnae 2-7 cm long, larger on vigorous twigs. USE: The
   flowers are a source of honey, wood is used as timber, paper pulp and
   fuel. The tree is used as a shade tree for highland coffee plantations
   in Cameroon and Central America. It is used for reforestation, as an
   ornamnetal and living fence. The tree is able to fix atmospheric
   nitrogen and throughout the year, it sheds large quantities of
   nitrogen-rich leaves that decompose rapidly and form rich humus. Often
   found growing in association with maize and beans. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Mimosa. FURTHER INF: It is native to the cool,
   subtropical plains of southeastern Brazil, but it is very robust and
   can grow in both warmer and drier areas. The species is not
   recommended, however, for areas with mean annual temperatures higher
   than 23Â°C. Although in its natural range, rainfall is generally well
   distributed throughout the year, the tree can tolerate dry periods of
   up to 4 months. It is susceptible to strong winds. It prefers
   free-draining soil. It tolerates strongly acid soils with pH as low as
   4.8 and those with high aluminium content; it does not tolerate
   waterlogged, compacted or severely degraded soils.
