   but may reach 20-30 m in height, with a straight or crooked trunk with

   furniture, woodenware, cellulose manufacture, and pulp. Bark and roots
   have medicinal properties. The tree can be grown as an ornamental, for
   shelter and erosion control. It is a hardy "city tree" very tolerant of
   pollution, dust and smoke. In Beijing, for example, it is used in urban
   forestry. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD

   Ailanthus, Tree of heaven, China sumac, Waliyati drawa, Shin-ju, Arbol
   del cielo, Gîtterbaum. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: glandulosa.
   Ailanthus is native of northern China. It can be found at elevations
   between sea level and 2000 m. It is a prolific seeder and takes root
   anywhere a little earth has accumulated, it can poke up through cracks
   in concrete and find its way under buildings and walls. So it has the
   ability to become a serious pest. Planting only root cuttings of male
   trees might avoid problems of uncontrollable self-seeding.
