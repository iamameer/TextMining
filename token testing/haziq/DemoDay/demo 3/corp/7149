   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous conifer reaching 9-40 or even 55 m in
   height. The crown of young trees is symmetrical, open, and narrowly
   conic. Old trees often have large, buttressed low branches that run
   level for 2.4-3 m before turning upward. It is deep-rooted. USE: The
   wood is durable and strong, of moderately high density, with excellent
   toughness and stiffness. It is used for pulp, framing timber, roof
   tiles, flooring, and log houses. It is suitable for veneer and other
   decorative purposes. It is resistant to rot, and is therefore valuable
   for posts, poles, railroad ties, mine props, wharves, and pilings. It
   is planted as an ornamental and in shelterbelts. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. It exhibits rapid early growth and occasionally early
   senescence (at 30 to 40 years of age), particularly in mixed stands.
   The average age at senescence is between 100 and 150 years of age. Ages
   of 600 years or more have been reported. COMMON NAMES: European larch
   (England). FURTHER INF:
