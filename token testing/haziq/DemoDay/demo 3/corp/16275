   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a rounded, spreading, evergreen shrub or tree
   usually reaching 5-20 m in height with an average maximum dbh. 0.8- 1.5
   m. On very good sites it may reach op to 30 m in height. In open
   stands, the dense canopy may reach nearly to the ground, while in
   closed stands, crowns tend to be of smaller diameter and take up only
   the top one-third to one-half of the tree. It may live to at least 250
   or 300 years of age. The bark is smooth to striped and the roots may
   reach to 7.3 m below the soil surface. The leaves are leathery and
   oblong. USE: It is, by volume, one of the most important California
   hardwoods. The wood is hard, stiff, and strong and can be used to make
   furniture, pallets, and attractive multi-colored paneling or veneer. It
   provides important habitat and feed for many animal species. It grows
   well on steep slopes which are prone to erosion and is an excellent
   soil stabilizer. It is planted as an ornamental and is well-suited for
   use in urban plantings. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Canyon
   live oak. FURTHER INF: It grows on steep, rocky, often exposed slopes
   or ridges, in narrow canyon bottoms, sheltered coves, rock crevices,
   dry washes, and arroyos. It grows well on a variety of well-drained
   soils including fine-grained, gravelly sandy loams, or poorly developed
   skeletal soils. Best growth occurs on rich, moist soils of canyon
   bottoms. The tree is shade-tolerant when young.
