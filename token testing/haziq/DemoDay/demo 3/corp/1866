   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Castor in tropical countries is an erect herbaceous shrub
   or a small plant 6-10 m tall; its longevity is 8-12 years. In moderate
   climates this plant has a woody stem 0.5-4 m tall and it dies during
   autumn due to frosts or as a result of desiccation. The taproot
   penetrates the soil up to 1.5-3 m, or in the case of a crop of many
   years standing, up to 5-6 m. Most important are the secondary lateral
   roots that spread in the ploughed layer up to 1 m. If there is
   insufficient moisture the root grows deep, with little lateral
   spreading, whereupon their development leads to growth of the above
   ground mass. The stems are succulent, herbaceous, very variable in all
   aspects - 7.5-15 cm in diameter. Its stem is geniculate, thick,
   branching and terminates with a raceme spike. In some of the varieties
   grown in Russia, the stem has from 5 to 12 nodes and the same number of
   leaves at a 30-100 cm height of stem, and the length of the internode
   is 6-10 cm. The dwarf varieties have short (1.5-3 cm) internodes. The
   castor plant is well foliated. Leaves are glabrous and alternate on the
   basis of a 2/5 layout, except the first two opposite leaves. They are
   10-16 cm wide, smooth, rarely wrinkled and have stipules at the base of
   their long (20-50 cm) glandular petioles. They are palmate - parted in
   7-9 lanceolate dentate lobes - the middle one being the largest. It has
   monoecious flowers - male and female flowers are on the same plant and
   form clusters (racemes) 10-40 cm long in terminal pannicles. The
   tubular perianth is 5-lobed. They are numerous in long inflorescences,
   petals absent in both sexes (male and female flowers are apetalous),
   sepals 3-5, greenish; stamens numerous, 5-10 mm long; ovary superior,
   3-celled with a short style and 3-6 stigmas. The upper fruit syncarp is
   a spherical or elongated dehiscent, fragile 3-sectioned dry capsule 2.5
   cm in diameter, 1-3.5 cm long with a wrinkled or smooth surface. It is
   borne on an elongated pedicel, and is often spiny. The colour of the
   ripening capsules is green, yellow, brown, red, crimson or violet;
   dried ones are often grey or brown. The seed of castor is nut-oval,
   tick-like, egg-shaped, rarely spherical or elongated in form, 0.8-3 cm
   long, 0.6-1.5 cm wide and 0.4-1.0 cm thick. It is carunculate. The
   seeds are covered by a dense, shiny but fragile hull of two colours.
   The background is dark, usually dark-gray, red or brown, rarely black
   or white; there are mosaic spots of various dimensions and colors;
   pink, white-brown, red, black. The pattern varying from fine to coarse,
   veined or finely dotted to large splotches. The integument and
   cotyledons are flat and slender. There are 1,000 to 11,000 seeds per
   kg; commercial varieties having 2,200 to 3,200 per kg. It is a C3
   pathway plant but with restricted assimilation of CO[2]. USES: The
   seeds yield a water-resistant fast-drying, non-yellowing oil, used
   mainly in industry and medicines. The oil is included in fuel mixtures
   for precision engines. Dehydrated oil is an excellent drying agent that
   compares favourably with tung oil and is used in paints and varnishes
   and as a basic ingredient in emollient soaps. It is used in coating
   fabrics and other protective coverings, in the manufacture of
   high-grade lubricants, transparent typewriter and printing inks, in
   textile dyeing (when converted into sulphonated castor oil or
   turkey-red oil, for dyeing cotton fabrics with alizarine) and in
   leather preservation. It is also used for plastics, ointments, and
   cosmetics. The seed has purgative and emollient properties and
   administration is as oil, capsules, enema, ointment and suppositories.
   Pharmacological compounds to combat hair-loss usually contain castor
   oil and it has an antidandruff effect. The expressed oil cakes are used
   as fertilizer and detoxified meal can be fed to livestock; although it
   is highly toxic due to its ricin (that has been used as a poison), a
   method of detoxicating the meal has now been found, so that it can
   safely be fed to livestock. Plant stems are made into paper and
   wallboard. NB.: The seeds must never be swallowed: 5-6 will kill a
   child, 10 will kill an adult - there is no specific antidote. KILLING
   T.: During the rest period it is -2^oC. It does not tolerate low
   temperatures during the growing period. GROWING PERIOD: Grown as an
   annual in temperate regions, and as a short-lived perennial under
   subtropical and tropical conditions. Growing period is 140-160 days for
   early cultivars, and 170-210 days for late cultivars. COMMON NAMES:
   Castor, Castorbean, Ricin, Ricino. FURTHER INF.: The name Ricinus is a
   Latin word for tick; the seed is so named because it has markings and a
   bump at the end, that resemble certain ticks. Castor perform best with
   a relative humidity of 30-60 %, ideally humidity should be higher
   during vegetative growth and lower during the period of maturity and
   harvest. To high humidity can lead to increased insect problems. Castor
   can be cultivated between 40°S and 52°N and it can be grown from
   sea-level up to 1500-3000 m in elevation, but it is best grown between
   300-1800 m. The photosynthesis pathway C3 II. The species is most
   probably indigenous to North-East Africa, especially Ethiopia. 1 ton of
   seed remove about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 12 kg K, and 4 kg Ca, and 3 kg Mg
   from the field. Unbalanced N-fertilizer encourages the growth of
   foliage at the expense of seed formation. The global average yield is
   0.75 t/ha, in Africa 0.5 t/ha but in the United States 3.0 t/ha are not
   exceptional under irrigation. The seeds of the plant are poisonous,
   eating a single seed may cause serious illness and the leaves should
   not be used as forage.
