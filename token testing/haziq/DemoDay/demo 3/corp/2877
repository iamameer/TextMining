   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Large deciduous tree reaching a height of 10-25 m
   and a trunk diameter of up to 40 cm. Scaly grey-brown bark, with a pink
   or red slash. The form is often bad. Pods flattened 12-17 x 5-8 x 3.5
   cm, glabrous, black, woody, persistent bursts open at maturity
   spreading the seeds. Seeds poisonous, with a sweet edible aril. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. Under favourable conditions the seeds germinate in
   10-20 days. USE: Wood hard, heavy, durable, termite-proof, light brown
   to red-brown in colour, excellent timber, difficult to work, though.
   Used in carpentry, canoe and house building, furniture making. A
   substitute for mahogany. Used in human medicine :febrifugal,
   analgaesic, anti-hemorrhageic, laxative, emetic, emmenagogic and
   aphrodisiac, the foliage is good cattle forage, particularly before the
   regrowth of grass in the early rainy season. Pods are rich in ashes
   used for making soap. As the leaves are rich in nitrogen they are used
   to enrich the soil. COMMON NAMES: African mahogany. FURTHER INF: The
   tree is widely distributed along the West Coast of Africa in
   semi-deciduous forest and Sudano-Guinean savannas up to the southern
   border of the Sahel. Found from Senegal to Uganda especially in areas
   with rainfall 1200-1800 mm. It can be found in the drier part of the
   tropical forests region in valleys, on the savanna and in areas
   fringing forests. It is fire resistant. It is a lowland species
   occurring at elevations up to 900 m. Found in well watered sites with a
   deep sandy soil; can adapt to lateritic soils.
