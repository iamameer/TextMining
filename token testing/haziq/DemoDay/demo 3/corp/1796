   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub or small deciduous tree reaching up to 8 m in
   height. The fruit is 3-8 cm in diameter, fleshy and yellow to red. USES
   The fruit can be used fresh, canned, dried, or frozen. The tree is
   grown as an ornamental and mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
   KILLING T Opened flowers are killed by frosts and the tree may be
   killed at temperatures about -5°C. GROWING PERIOD Perennial deciduous
   tree, that bear after 2-4 years and with an economic life of 8-12
   years. Period per year about 300-330 days. COMMON NAMES Peach,
   Nectarine, Brugnon, Pecher, Persik, Peras, Khai, Makmuan, Tho, Hung
   mon, Dao. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: Amygdalus persica, Persica
   vulgaris. Peach is native of Iran or China. It thrive best in areas
   with medium to low relative air humidity, but the trees must have
   continuous soil moisture during the growing season. Areas that
   regularly have late spring frosts are not suitable for peach
   production. The trees usually require 100-400 hours with temperatures
   less than 5-7°C to overcome the dormancy period, some varieties,
   however, require less winter chilling. It can be grown in tropical
   highlands in seasonal climate at elevations between 1200-2000 m and in
   the subtropics. The kernels are toxic. A bee population is needed for
   pollination. Humid conditions during the ripening of the fruit are
   undesirable because they favour the development of brown rot. Late
   frosts may kill flowers and summer rains may lead to diseases. Annual
   fruit yields may be between 10-25 t/ha.
