   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Deciduous or semi-evergreen, monoecious tree reaching
   35-55 m in height. The bole is straight and cylindrical, branchless up
   to 20-30) m and up to 1-2 m in diameter, sometimes fluted, with short
   buttresses up to 2 m high. USE: The timber is moderately soft to
   moderately hard, strong and moderately tough. Good working properties
   with a moderate dulling effect on tools and a slight tendency to split
   on nailing; glues well and polishes satisfactorily. Heartwood is
   moderately durable and resistant to termites. Wood also used for pulp
   and paper. The bark is used for tanning and oil is obtained from the
   seeds. Seed oil has insecticidal properties. The bark contains an
   alkaloid, carapina, that is used as a febrifuge. Leaves boiled in water
   are applied to itchy skin. Fruit rind decoction is taken orally for
   fever and intestinal worms; a seed oil decoction is taken orally for
   hepatitis and tetanus and applied externally for skin diseases and
   ringworm. Also used as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: bois rouge, carapa (French). FURTHER INF: It is a common element
   of the canopy or subcanopy layer of some of the South American
   evergreen to semi-evergreen rainforest. It sometimes occurs as a
   dominant tree or even in almost pure stands and is found predominantly
   along rivers and on periodically flooded or swampy locations but also
   on higher ground and low hills. The tree is not exacting about soil,
   provided it is not too dry.
