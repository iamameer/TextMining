   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb reaching 50-150 cm in height, while the root
   system may reach 50-100 cm below the soil surface. It has rosette
   leaves and more scattered leaves on the stems and a single dark or
   violet-shaded to white flower on each stem, developing into a capsular
   with seeds. USES The latex from the unripe capsular, called opium, has
   medicinal properties and narcotic effects. The nonnarcitic seed can be
   used in bakery or extracted for an oil used in paints, varnishes and
   soap. The plant has attractive flowers and are used as an ornamental in
   flower gardens. KILLING T The sprouts can survive -5Â°C. GROWING PERIOD
   Annual, grown as a winter crop in the subtropics it require 135-170
   days to mature and as a summer crop in temperate areas it require
   150-210 days. Under optimal conditions the growing stages may be as
   follow: germination period 15-20 days, rosette stage 50-60 days,
   elongation and branching period 25-30 days, blossoming and seed
   formation stage 20-30 days, and ripening period 15-25 days. COMMON
   NAMES Opium poppy. FURTHER INF Opium poppy is native to the
   Mediterranean region or western Asia. It is sensitive to strong winds
   and sensitive to rain at harvest. Dry warm weather is most appropriate
   at the time of flowering and capsule ripening. The crop extracts about
   102.5 kg of N, 192 kg of P and 11.4 kg of K from the soil to produce
   3.5 t/ha of vegetative mass and 1.2 t/ha of fruit. Poppy should not be
   grown on the same field more than 3-5 years running. Opium obtained
   from the immature capsules have analgesic and narcotic effects. Seed
   yields of 2.2-3.0 t/ha are possible, although 1.2-1.8 t/ha are more
   usual, the optimum yield of dry capsule is 2.0 t/ha.
