   height, while the trunk may reach 150-250 cm in diameter. It is a
   well-formed tree with a long straight trunk, slight buttresses and a
   fine-textured dark green crown. It is also common as an understorey
   tree 6-18 m tall or at high altitudes and on sites exposed to the wind
   as a shrub less than 1.5 m tall. Sapwood pink, heartwood pink to
   red-brown with straight or slightly interlocked grain, occasionally a
   wary figure, fine uniform texture, moderate strength, hard and tough
   but only moderately durable and with visible growth rings. USES The
   wood works well and has excellent bending qualities. It is a good
   furniture and cabinet timber, also used for panelling, parquetry,
   veneers, turnery and formely heels for shoes.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial deciduous tree or shrub. COMMON NAMES Mytle,
   Myrtle beech. FURTHER INF The latitudinal range in Australia is about
   37-43Â°S. The tree can be found at elevations between sea level and 1600
   m, but above 900 m it is reduced to a shrub. Mytle is not fire
   resistant.
