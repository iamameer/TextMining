   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is very coarse, tall herbaceous plant, usually up to
   2.5-3 m high. The stout, round stems are purplish, aromatic, and
   hollow. Basal leaves are pinnately more than once divided, and upper
   leaves are progressively reduced with broadly sheathing leaf stalks and
   serrate, pointed leaflets. The inflorescence is a large (10-20 cm
   wide), spherical compound umbel with 20-45 rays. Flowers are white or
   greenish-white and in bloom around the first week in June. Thin, flat
   lateral wings occur on the hairless fruit, which fall by mid-summer.
   USE: Besides its use as a flavouring in confections and liqueurs, it
   has been recommended as an antiflatulant, a diuretic, a diaphoretic
   (sweat producer), and a counterirritant. There is no proof that it is
   particularly effective in any of these applications. Cases of toxicity
   have been reported when large amounts have been taken to try to induce
   abortion. Studies have shown that various compounds contained in the
   volatile oil are acutely toxic and mutagenic in laboratory animals.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Great angelica. FURTHER INF:
   It is common in sedge meadows and calcareous fens, particularly if
   supported by groundwater springs and seepages. It also may be present
   in forested wetlands, and along streambanks and shores.
