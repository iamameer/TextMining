   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A shrub 2 to 5 m high with long, thin, rambling branches
   covered with small scattered thorns. The leaves are fairly large and
   the white flowers are in globose heads. The pods are thin, flat and
   broad. USE: Goats browse on this bush to a considerable extent, eating
   the leaves, flowers and young pods. It is seldom eaten by cattle
   because of its thorny branches. The leaves and young pods have a
   protein content of 17 to 19 percent. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: FURTHER INF: It is widespread in woodland savannas of Africa,
   being found in the Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Zaire, Angola,
   Natal and Cape Province. In Kenya, it occurs at 1600 to 2000 m in
   elevation, where it often forms dense thickets on well-drained slopes
   in deep and fertile red soil. It is one of the species within the
   Acacia genus that is non-nodulating.
