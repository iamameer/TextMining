   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an erect, sometimes solitary palm reaching 20-30 m
   in height. Full grown palms have an almost bare stem, slightly conical
   with a diameter of 20-50 cm. Surface grey to brown, smooth and
   obscurely ringed with leaf scars, adventitious roots sometimes visible
   at the base of the stem. The stem carries a dense crown, of arching
   pinnate leaves, with a diameter of about 8 m. It consists of 15-20
   leaves, each reaching 5-8 m in length. The top leaves are typically
   pointing upward. The inflorescence is cream-white turning yellow and
   finally brownish at anthesis. Flowers unisexual. Staminate flowers
   yellowish, slightly fragrant, asymmetrical with 3 sepals and 2-3
   petals. Pistillate flowers cream-yellow with 3-6 sepals and 3-5 petals.
   It produces fruit in large bunches containing, on average, 200
   individual fruits and attaining a length of one meter or more. However,
   bunches with up to 600 fruits do occur. Bunches may have very long
   stalks. The individual bunch weights range from 40-90 kg and the tree
   produces 1-4 bunches each year. Production starts when it is around 8
   years old. The individual fruits are 8-15 cm long and 5-9 cm broad and
   weigh 150-200 g. Palms growing wild produce only 20 kg/ha compared to
   1500 kg/ha in experimental plantations. This is largely due to the
   greater tree density. Each fruit contains 3-8 kernels. USES: The kernel
   yields 60-70% of oil, which is somewhat similar to coconut oil. It is
   colourless and does not readily become rancid. Refined oil can be used
   for margarine production and general food purposes. The crude oil is
   suitable for soap production and detergents. It is also used for
   burning in lamps. In addition to its importance for the extraction of
   edible oil the Babassu palm can be used to make many products during
   its life cycle. The leaves are used for thatch, basketwork,
   construction and fodder, the trunks for bridges and building and the
   fruit for animal feed and charcoal. The palm is of considerable
   economic importance in rural Brazil and it is estimated that some 450
   000 families collect and process Babassu. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Babassu, babaçu, aguassu, coco de macaco. FURTHER INF.:
   It requires a tropical humid climate and high temperatures with plenty
   of sunshine. It is mainly found on moderately drained alluvial sandy
   soils that are not exposed to water logging or flooding. It requires
   fertile soil. It may become a weed. The apical meristem remains below
   ground for several years after the leaves have emerged. This makes it
   an aggressive competitor in some circumstances and control is therefore
   difficult.
