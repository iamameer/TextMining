   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A densely tufted grass. Young culms prostrate to
   semi-erect up to 90 cm tall, later erect to 1-1.8 m tall. Leaf blades
   3-25 cm long, 2-8 mm wide. Producing up to 3 m long, creeping stolons.
   Inflorescence a sub-digitate panicle, mostly comprising 2-5
   racemes.USES: It is very palatable and grown for pasture and hay as
   permanent pasture in seasonally flooded or waterlogged land providing
   thick, lush growth. It withstands heavy grazing. Suitable for grazing
   and cut-and-carry, and for hay before flowering. Good for waterway and
   bank stabilisation. GROWING PERIOD: Summer-growing perennial grass.
   COMMON NAMES: Angleton grass, Alabang X, Angleton bluestem,
   Wildergrass. FURTHER INF: Angleton grass is native of India and
   introduced in Australia, Africa and America. Mostly in moderately dry
   to moist areas with annual summer rainfall from 750-1400 mm, but also
   as low as 650 mm and as high as 2000 mm, sometimes with a long dry
   season. Moderately drought tolerant and very tolerant of flooding and
   waterlogging. Occurs mostly on dark or red clay soils, with a neutral
   to alkaline pH. Generally not suited to light textured soils. Often
   found on fertile soils, but not fertility demanding. Moderately
   tolerant of salinity. It is a vigorous grass with a tendency to
   dominate and become a weed in some areas. Average dry matter yield in
   United States is 10 t/ha.
