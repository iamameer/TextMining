   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect and trailing pubescent herbaceous legume. Leaves
   trifoliolate with stipules about 5 mm long, leaflets 3.4ˆ6 cm long and
   3ˆ3.8 cm wide. Flowers purple-red in colour. Pods 4ˆ9 cm long. USE:
   Used as a short-term pasture plant. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Burgundy bean. FURTHER INF: Native of subtropical and tropical
   South America. It occurs between 10- 27°S, and up to 12°N. It can be
   found at more than 1200 m at 24°S (average annual temperature 17.5°C)
   to lower altitude areas with average annual temperature of 25°C. It
   commences growth at lower temperatures than many other tropical and
   subtropical legumes. It has been used successfully at temperatures
   above 35°C. Found in areas with annual rainfall from 400ˆ1600 mm but is
   being used in subtropical environments with summer-dominant rainfall
   between 600 and 1000 mm. Very drought tolerant and has persisted for at
   least 3 years on shallow clay soils with extreme mid-season droughts.
   Usually found on light to medium textured soils, but adapts well to
   heavy clays. Soil pH requirements near neutral to alkaline, but can
   adapt to soil of pH 4.5.
