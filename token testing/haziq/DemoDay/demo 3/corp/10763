   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a bushy shrub or well-formed tree up to 7 m in
   height. Bark light grey or brown, rather rough and longitudinally
   flaking. Leaves lanceolate to oblong; up to 28 x 10 cm, but usually
   about 10-15 x 4-5 cm. Leathery, medium to dark green. Fruit a small
   nutlet, with minute glands and bristly hairs on the body and a long
   tuft of bristly hairs at the top. USE: Leaves, although rather bitter
   to taste, are eaten as raw vegetables. ŒChewsticks‚ from the roots and
   twigs are regarded as an appetizer. Leaves and shoots used as fodder
   and wood used as timber, firewood and charcoal. An infusion from the
   roots is given to children suffering from infection by a trematode
   (Enterobius vermicularis). A cold infusion of the root bark, together
   with other plants, is given in daily doses to treat bilharzia. The bark
   and root are taken as a tonic by people suffering from fevers; leaves
   are also pounded, the juice extracted and drunk for fever. The leaves
   are pounded and mixed with warm water for bathing to treat spots on the
   skin and nausea. It can be planted for erosion control and as an
   ornamental. The termite-resistant branches are useful as stakes for
   lining out plantations and as a live fence. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: bitter leaf, vernonia tree. FURTHER INF: It can be found
   in Afro-mountain forest and secondary mountain evergreen bushland and
   sometimes forming clumps in upland wooded grassland. Elsewhere also in
   lowland humid rangeland, savannah and riverine fringes on light shallow
   soils, often associated with termite mounds.
