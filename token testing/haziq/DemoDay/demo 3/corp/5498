   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium-sized to tall evergreen tree reaching a
   height of up to 45-55 m and a girth of 4-5 m. The bole is often
   straight, cylindrical and about 20-30 m tall. USES The timber is used
   for medium to heavy constructions but it is not very durable in contact
   with the ground. When treated with a preservative the timber can also
   be used outdoors. Because of its resinous nature it is less suitable
   for flooring and woodwork exposed to the sun, or to be painted. It is
   used for veneer, plywwod, paper pulp and charcoal. An oleo-resin can be
   extracted and used as a coat for waterproofing paper, as a varnish for
   boats, walls and furniture. The oleo-resin and also the bark of the
   tree have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
   Hairy-leafed apitong, Dulia garjan, Gurjan, Apinau, Ayamban, Chhe:
   ti:el bangku:ey, Chhe: ti:el ba:y, Chhe: ti:el tuk, Nha:ng, Nha:ng
   kha:w, Yang-na. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: D. philippinensis.
   Gurjan can be found in Bangladesh, Myanmar and on the Andamans Islands
   at elevations between sea level and 450 m. It is typically found on
   alluvial soils along the banks of large fresh water streams, along the
   bottom of ridges, in valleys and in moist and swampy areas. The tree
   can in the early stages persist under heavy shade for several years. It
   is sensitive to fire and high winds. Yields may be 30-60 m3/ha/year.
