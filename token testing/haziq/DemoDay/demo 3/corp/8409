   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a perennial, aquatic, herbaceous plant reaching
   25-75 cm in height. It has bright green, smooth, succulent, arrow- to
   heart-shaped, erect, 10-75 cm long, 7.5-20 cm wide leaves. They emerge
   annually from perennial bulbs. USE: The plant is rich in calcium
   oxylate, which is toxic. However, calcium oxylate is easily destroyed
   by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant. The seed, spadix and roots
   are edible after they have been well cooked. It is grown as an
   ornamental for its decorative foliage. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Green arrow arum. FURTHER INF: It commonly inhabits
   shallow water areas of marshes, bogs, swamps, stream and river bottoms,
   lakes, ponds, and ditches. It prefers fertile, unconsolidated silty or
   organic sites, which are saturated or inundated up to 30 cm. It can
   however also grow in less fertile soils with a low organic content. It
   tolerates salinity up to 2 ppt. It can be found throughout most of
   eastern North America from southern Canada southward. Also known from
   the Pacific Coast States.
