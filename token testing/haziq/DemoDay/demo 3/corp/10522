   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A sparingly hairy annual legume 30-90 cm in height; stems
   erect or ascending, branching from the base or above. Leaves, all
   except the uppermost, alternate; adnate parts of stipules oblong,
   membranous with green nerves; free portion as long as or shorter than
   the lower part. Leaflets 1.5-3.5 (-5) x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, oblong-elliptical
   to oblong-lanceolate, tapering at both ends, mucronate at apex,
   denticulate in upper part. Heads terminal, axillary, pedunculate 1.5-2
   x 1.5-2 cm, conical to ovoid, often with a few bracts forming a minute
   involucre at the base of the head. Flowers 0.8-1.3 cm; calyx tube
   obconical to campanulate with ten prominent nerves; corolla cream
   coloured 1.5-2 times as long as calyx; standard considerably longer
   than wings. Fruiting head 1.5-2.5 x 1-1.5 cm, not disarticulating at
   maturity; pods 2-2.2 x 1.4-1.9 cm; egg-shaped seeds solitary 1.4 x 1.9
   mm. It is entomophilous and cross-pollinated. USES: Grown as a forage
   plant. It is used as green chop or ensilage. It is mainly grown in
   arable rotations for green feed for stall-fed stock, mainly cattle and
   milk buffaloes; it is valued as a fertility-building crop. It is
   commonly integrated into rice-wheat cropping systems as a winter and
   spring feed; it may be seeded into rice before the harvest of the
   cereal. Some is now grown as an annual or catch crop fodder on
   large-scale farms, usually rain-fed; the season depending on the
   climate. KILLING T.: The plant may withstand -2 to -3^oC and basal
   parts of the adult plant may survive down to -6 to -8^oC. 25% of a
   stand of the cultivar 'Sacramento' have been reported to survived
   -15Â°C. However, most cultivars only tolerate light frosts. Plants may
   not survive temperatures above 40^oC. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. In
   Florida, it is sown in October-November; it provides forage in
   January-May, flowers in April-May and fruits in June. Under good
   growing conditions it may be cut every 35 to 45 days during a season
   lasting eight to ten months. It propagates itself by seed. COMMON
   NAMES: Egyptian clover, berseem clover, Alexandrian clover, bersim,
   trefle d'Alexandrie, trefle alexandrin, bersyn, berzoon, barsim masri,
   barsim. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: T. maritinum, T.
   panormitanum. Egyptian clover is probably indigenous to Egypt and
   western Asia. It is of ancient cultivation in Egypt where it is a major
   winter crop; from there it was introduced to Sindh in the early years
   of the twentieth century where it proved so well adapted to the
   conditions and farming systems of the irrigated tracts of the
   sub-continent and spread rapidly throughout northern India. It is now
   the major rabi season fodder and cultivated on millions of hectares:
   this is probably the most rapid spread of a fodder in recent times and
   is all the more notable for being mainly under smallholder conditions.
   It is grown in the USA and, as both a winter and summer crop, in parts
   of southern Europe. Average yields of multi-cut varieties vary between
   20-60 t/ha of fresh herbage. Dry matter yields of 4-8 t/ha may be
   obtained.
