   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small, evergreen tree, averaging 12 m or more in
   height but kept to 6m with regular pruning. The root system is
   relatively shallow, and will not tolerate waterlogged soils. It has
   many thin branches with opposite branchlets and shortly-stalked,
   opposite, lanceolate leaves about 6 cm long, acute, entire and smooth,
   pale green above and silvery below. The bark is pale grey and the
   flowers numerous, small and creamy white in colour and are largely
   hidden by the evergreen leaves and grow on a long stem arising from the
   leaf axils. The olive produces two kinds of flowers: a perfect flower
   containing both male and female parts, and a staminate flower with
   stamens only. The flowers are largely wind pollinated with most olive
   varieties being self-pollinating, although fruit set is usually
   improved by cross-pollination with other varieties. There are
   self-incompatible varieties that do not set fruit without other
   varieties nearby, and there are varieties that are incompatible with
   certain others. Incompatibility can also occur for environmental
   reasons such as high temperatures. The dark purple fruit is a drupe
   about 2 cm long, ovoid and often pointed, the fleshy part filled with
   oil. The pulp is bitter, due to tannin in the raw fruit, and contains
   up to 20% oil. The thick, bony stone has a blunt keel down one side. It
   contains a single seed. The seeds of a few varieties are green when
   ripe and some turn a shade of copper brown. The cultivars vary
   considerably in size, shape, oil-content and flavor. The shapes range
   from almost round to oval or elongated with pointed ends. The trees
   reach bearing age in about 4 years.
   USES: Olive oil, an unsaturated fat, has recently become more valued
   for its health benefits; the oil component includes unsaturated fatty
   acid (70% to 80% oleic acid and 7% to 12% linoleic acid), and small
   amounts of polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, and many aromatic
   compounds. The ripe fruits are pressed to extract the oil, the methods
   varying in different countries. Virgin oil, greenish in tint, is
   obtained by pressing crushed fruit in coarse bags and skimming the oil
   from the tubs of water through which it is conducted. The cake left in
   the bags is broken up, moistened, and repressed. For use as a dessert
   fruit the unripe olives are steeped in water to reduce their
   bitterness. Olive soap is made from olive oil and sodium hydroxide. The
   beautifully veined wood not only takes a fine polish, but is faintly
   fragrant, and is much valued for small cabinetwork. It was in olden
   days carved into statues of gods. The leaves are astringent and
   antiseptic. Both leaves and bark have valuable febrifugal qualities.
   The oil is a nourishing demulcent and laxative. Externally, it relieves
   pruritis, the effects of stings or burns, and is a good vehicle for
   liniments. With alcohol it is a good hair-tonic. As a lubricant it is
   valuable in skin, muscular, joint, kidney and chest complaints, or
   abdominal chill, typhoid and scarlet fevers, plague and dropsies. It is
   often used in enemas. It is the best fat for cooking, and a valuable
   article of diet for both sick and healthy of all ages. It can easily be
   taken with milk, orange or lemon juice, etc.
   The high position held by the Olive tree in ancient as in modern days
   may be realized when it is remembered that Moses exempted from military
   service men who would work at its cultivation, and that in Scriptural
   and classical writings the oil is mentioned as a symbol of goodness and
   purity, and the tree as representing peace and happiness. The oil, in
   addition to its wide use in diet, was burnt in the sacred lamps of
   temples, while the victor in the Olympic games was crowned with its
   leaves.
   KILLING T.: It is injured when temperatures fall below -10 degrees C.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial: olives are long-lived with a life expectancy
   of 500 years. The trees are also tenacious, easily sprouting back even
   when chopped to the ground.
   FURTHER INF.: The olive is native to the Mediterranean region, tropical
   and central Asia and various parts of Africa. The olive has a history
   almost as long as that of Western civilization, its development being
   one of civilized man's first accomplishments. At a site in Spain,
   carbon dating has shown olive seed found there to be eight thousand
   years old. O. europaea may have been cultivated independently in two
   places, Crete and Syria. Archaeological evidence suggests that olives
   were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2,500 B.C. From Crete and
   Syria olives spread to Greece, Rome and other parts of the
   Mediterranean area. Olives are also grown commercially in California,
   Australia and South Africa.
   Proper pruning is important for the olive. Pruning both regulates
   production and shapes the tree for easier harvest. The trees can
   withstand radical pruning, so it is relatively easy to keep them at a
   desired height. The problem of alternate bearing can also be avoided
   with careful pruning every year. It should be kept in mind that the
   olive never bears fruit in the same place twice, and usually bears on
   the previous year's growth. For a single trunk, prune suckers and any
   branches growing below the point where branching is desired. Prune
   flowering branches in early summer to prevent olives from forming.
   Olive trees can also be pruned to espaliers. None of the cultivated
   varieties can be propagated by seed. Seed propagated trees revert to
   the original small-fruited wild variety. The seedlings can, of course,
   be grafted or chip budded with material from desired cultivars. The
   variety of an olive tree can also be changed by bark grafting or top
   working. Another method of propagation is transplanting suckers that
   grow at the base of mature trees. However, these would have to be
   grafted if the suckers grew from the seedling rootstock. A commonly
   practiced method is propagation from cuttings. Thirty-thirty five cm
   long, two-seven cm wide cuttings from the two-year old wood of a mature
   tree is treated with a rooting hormone, planted in a light-rooting
   medium and kept moist. Trees grown from such cuttings can be further
   grafted with wood from another cultivar. Cutting grown trees bear fruit
   in about four years.
   The type of harvest depends upon fruit use. Oil olives are harvested by
   hand or by mechanically shaking the tree. Those for pickling must still
   be harvested by hand as the fruit bruises easily. Olives will grow well
   on almost any well-drained soil up to pH 8.5 and are tolerant of mild
   saline conditions. Because the olive has fewer natural enemies than
   other crops, and because the oil in olives retains the odor of chemical
   treatments, the olive is one of the least sprayed crops. It requires a
   long, hot growing season to properly ripen the fruit, no late spring
   frosts to kill the blossoms and sufficient winter chill to insure fruit
   set. Hot, dry winds may be harmful during the period when the flowers
   are open and the young fruits are setting. The trees survive and fruit
   well even with considerable neglect. The olive tree has a wide range of
   adaptability. It requires a mild climate with warm summers and cold
   winters. The tree requires substantial chilling for good fruiting.
   Olive is considered a drought-resistant species because it thrives in
   areas where water stress is frequent. Olives are wind pollinated, thus
   flowering during rain; high temperatures and dry wind conditions are
   deleterious to good fruit set. Mature olive trees produce huge numbers
   of flowers, but the fruit set is normally below 5%. Most olive
   cultivars will set some fruit in a mono-cultivar culture. However, they
   benefit greatly from cross-pollination. Olives are picked late in
   autumn or winter, as the oil content and fruit characteristics change
   with ripening.
