   Hawaii and widely planted for timber in Australia, New Zealand, South
   Africa, Chile, Spain, and the British Isles. The tree is drought hardy
   and tolerates salt winds. It occurs in areas of fog where other factors
   are not limiting. Annual wood production potential is 12-30 m3/ha. It
   occurs is humid climates with mild year-round temperatures. Winters are
