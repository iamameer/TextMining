   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a perennial, monoecious shrub or small tree up to 6
   m high; bark pale brown, papery, peeling; slash exudes a copious watery
   latex, soapy to tough but soon becoming brittle and brownish when dry;
   branches glabrous, ascending, stout. Leaves alternate, palmate,
   petiolate, stipulate; stipules minute; petiole 2-20 cm long, blade 3-5
   lobed, 12.5-18 x 11-16 cm, lobes acute or shortly acuminate at the
   apex, margins entire or undulating, leaf base deeply cordate, glabrous
   or pubescent only on the veins below, basal veins 7-9, prominent,
   venation reticulate. Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches
   and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The
   plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally
   hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls
   of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity
   to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to
   about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma.
   Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary
   3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid. Fruit an
   ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning
   black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x
   1-1.1 cm. Pollination is by insects. The rare hermaphroditic flowers
   can be self-pollinating. After pollination the trilocular ellipsoid
   fruit is formed. The exocarp remains fleshy until the seeds are mature.
   In Thailand, there are 2 flowering peaks, in November and May. In
   permanently humid equatorial regions, flowering occurs throughout the
   year. Fruit development needs 90 days from flowering until seeds
   mature. Shrubs begin to produce at 4-5 months and reach full
   productivity at about 3 years. The female flowers are 4-5 times more
   numerous than the male ones. USES: Young leaves may be safely eaten
   when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of
   Mexico. The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. The seed oil is
   renewable source of non-conventional bio-diesel. Fruit hulls and seed
   shells can be used as a fuel. Curcas oil contains a toxin, curcasin.
   The seed oil as well as seeds, leaves and bark have medicinal
   properties. It is grown for erosion control, as living fence and as a
   support for vanilla and other climbers. All plant parts can be used as
   a green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Barbados nut,
   castor oil, Chinese castor oil, curcas, fig nut, physic nut, pig nut,
   purging nut, wild oil nut (English). FURTHER INF.: It is best adapted
   to arid and semi-arid conditions. It occurs in grassland-savannah and
   thorn forest scrub but is completely lacking from the moist Amazon
   region. The current distribution shows that introduction has been most
   successful in drier regions of the tropics. It is very tolerant and
   thrives under a wide range of edapho-climatic conditions. It is
   particularly hardy at medium altitude and in humid zones. It is not
   sensitive to day length. Its strength as a crop comes from its ability
   to grow on poor, dry sites. However, like any species that being
   adapted as a crop the yields are correlated with inputs. It is very
   drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost. It has been widely
   reported as resistant to pests and diseases; however due to increasing
   use as a monoculture for bio-diesel this is proving not to be the case.
   NB.: It is being classified as an invasive species in the Pacific. It
   is reported as native to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
   Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama and exotic to Angola, Antigua
   and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil,
   Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic,
