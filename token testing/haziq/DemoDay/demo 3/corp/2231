   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall, handsome, deciduous tree with a relatively
   open crown reaching 30-50 m in height. The fruits are borne in clusters
   of 4-12, they are globose to oblong drupes, angled and narrowly 4
   winged, 2.5-7 cm x 1.25-2.5 cm. USES The nuts are used in confectionery
   and cakes or sold raw and salted. An edible nut is extracted from the
   seeds and used in the manufacture of cosmetics and certain drugs. The
   wood is coarse and brittle but used for fuel and tool handles. The nut
   shells are used as paving for walks and driveways, fuel, mulches, soil
   conditioners, soft abrasives in hand soap, nonskid paints and metal
   polishes, and for tannin. They can also be ground into flour or used as
   fillers in plastic wood, adhesives, and dynamite. KILLING T Tolerate
   considerable winter cold without damage (-20°C), but require a long
   frost-free growing season. Late spring frost is injurious to young
   trees. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. It bear after 4-5 years, and have an
   economical life up to 20-25 years or 130 years. Wild trees up to 1000
   years old are said to exist. With a growing season of 170 days fruit
   delevopment is pure but the tree grows well. COMMON NAMES Pecan nut,
   Pacane, Noce americana, Noix de pecan, Hickory nut, Pecan, Pecannusss,
   Nuez de pecan, Pacana, Noix d'hickory, Noix pacane, Noix d'Amerique,
   Noce pecan. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms: C. pecan, C. olivaeformis,
   C. oliviformis, Hicoria pecan, Hicorus olivaeformis, Juglans
   augustifolia, J. cylindrica, J. illinoensis, J. olivaeformis, J. pecan,
   J. rubra. Pecan nut is native of the rich bottom lands of the
   Mississippi Valley in south central United States west to Kansas and
   Texas and at higher altitudes south into central Mexico. It can be
   grown from sea level up to altitudes of 800 m. It require frost in the
   winter to overcome bud dormancy and permit proper vegetative growth in
   the spring, and the tree also require a period of two months of winter
   dormancy. Pecan nut perform best in areas of low to moderate humidity.
   Optimum temperature for photosynthesis is 27°C. Yields from 9-27 kg per
   tree at 8-10 years rising to 45-68 kg at 16 years while exceptional
   trees may yields as much as 360 kg. The optimum yield is about 2 t/ha.
