   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen or deciduous shrub or small, spreading
   tree reaching 3-13 m in height, with a diameter at breast height of up
   to 25 cm. The bark is rough, greyish-black, fibrous, with longitudinal
   fissures and brown to yellow slash, young branchlets
   stellate-tomentose, becoming glabrescent when mature. Leaves alternate,
   palmate with 3-5 lobes, up to 20 x 20 cm. USE: Ripe fruit carpels are
   edible, it may be eaten raw if gathered green and juicy and the rind is
   peeled off. Boiled, it is widely used as a relish or made into
   porridge. The leaves make a relish or can be burned to produce salts.
   It is browsed by game and in the dry season by cattle. It provides
   firewood and fibre. A decoction is made from the roots and taken orally
   for painful menstruation and to treat coughs and chest pains. An
   infusion made from the roots and leaves is dropped into the ear to
   treat earache or taken orally as an antiemetic. The tree can be planted
   for shade and as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering
   takes place during the rainy season, fruit ripening occurs during the
   dry season. It takes about 6 months from flower fertilization to fruit
   ripening. COMMON NAMES: snotappel (Afrikaans), African chewing gum,
   snot apple (English). FURTHER INF: It can adapt to various climatic
   conditions and soil types. It grows naturally in wooded grasslands,
   open woodlands and thickets. It is widespread in tropical eastern and
   southern Africa. It is drought resistant but thrives with abundant
   water during the rainy season. It can withstand mild frost. It prefers
   light yellow-brown to reddish-yellow gritty, sandy clay loams, but is
   often found on black to dark grey and brown clays.
