   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a small, heavily branched tree, typically 4.5-7.5 m
   tall but occasionally reaching 15 m. The bole is fluted with high
   narrow ribs separated by deep indentations. Bole length occasionally
   reaches 3.6 m but normally ranges within .2-1.8 m. Stems often crooked.
   Leaves have a slender, common stalk 5-10 cm long with 8-13 leaflets
   sometimes nearly opposite USE: The pods and leaves can be used as
   animal fodder. Wood is used as timber and fuel. The roots are used in
   traditional medicines to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and syphilis.
   The wood smoke is inhaled to treat headaches and bronchitis. It is
   visited by a large number of bees. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: African black wood., African ebony, African ironwood, Senegal
   ebony (English). FURTHER INF: It grows under a wide range of conditions
   including semi-arid, subhumid and tropical lowland areas. It is often
   found on dry, rocky sites but is most frequent in the mixed deciduous
   forests and savannahs of the coastal region. This species demands water
   and light and therefore is common near water and will not regenerate
   under heavy cover. Mature trees are fire tolerant. Soils vary from
   loamy sands to clayey Vertisols.
