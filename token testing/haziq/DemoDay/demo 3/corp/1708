   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen, coniferous tree typically reaching
   25-30 m in height but may reach up to 50 m. The crown is broadly
   conical and dense. USE: The timber is used for furniture, pulpwood,
   plywood, composite boards, posts, poles, pilings, crates, boxes,
   pallets. The tree is also planted to stabilize eroded or damaged soils.
   It can be used for shade or ornamental trees, as well as bark mulch.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Loblolly pine. FURTHER INF:
   The term "loblolly" literally means "mudhole" which can be used to
   describe the wet soil conditions on which this tree occurs naturally.
   Their best growth is on moderately acid soils in areas of poor surface
   drainage which consists of a thick, medium-textured surface layer and
   fine-textured subsoil. They do not grow well, however, on very wet or
   water-logged sites, or in areas with shallow or eroded soils. The tree
   grows best in moist sites, but it can grow in drier areas and compete
   with other pines. It is mostly found on Ultisol soils, although small
   areas of Entisols, Spodosols, and Alfisols are scattered throughout its
   range. Productivity is sensitive to soil fertility; if poorly drained
   soils have low fertility, usually there is a decrease in productivity.
   Also, the presence of a spodic horizon along the root zone causes a
   decline in productivity. This tree is planted on Histosols following
   artificial drainage and site preparation. It can be found at elevations
   from 1300 to 2700 m. The latitudinal range of natural occurrence is
   28-39Â°N. The tree is frost resistant. Annual wood production potential
   is 12-30 m3/ha.
