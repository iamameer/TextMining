   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A tufted, decumbent to erect grass up to 1.2-1.3 m high
   with open tussocky habit. Leaves uasually about 10-85 cm long and 3-15
   mm wide, folded at the base. USE: Used as pasture it will decrease
   under cotinuous grazing, but responds well to rests of about 30 days.
   It should be grazed when young. Can also be used for silage and as an
   understorey in coconut plantations, and in ley pastures following a
   rice crop. GROWING PERIOD: Summer-growing perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Brown seed paspalum. FURTHER INF: Synonyms: P. undulatum, Panicum
   plicatulum. It is native of southern North America, Central and South
   America. It can be found at latitudes between 32째S and 31째N at
   elevations between sea level and 1500 m. Found in areas with annual
   rainfall between 760-3500 mm and annual average temperatures of
   17-27째C. Optimum temperature for growth range between 9-23째C. Tops are
   burnt off by frost, but crowns survive. It is adapted to marshy or
   aquatic habitats, usually growing in shallow water and is suited to
   infertile coastal soils which are flooded in the wet season and then
   dry out rapidly. It tolerates short droughts, prolonged flooding and
   burning. Grows on a wide range of soils from poor to well-drained sands
   to clays, usually of low fertility and acid reaction - pH (4-) 4.5-5.5
   (-7). It is fairly tolerant of high soil aluminium. Flower initiation
   occurred at bisbane at a day length of 13.1 hours. Dry matter yields
   may be between 8.5-24 t/ha.
