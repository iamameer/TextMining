   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Diffuse, scrambling shrub up to 3-4 m in open situations
   and up to 8 meters in forests. Often forming dense thickets. Stems
   yellowish, smooth with opposite wide-spreading branches. USE: In recent
   decades it has become a serious pest in the humid tropics of South East
   Asia, Africa and Pacific Islands. It spreads rapidly in lands used for
   forestery, pasture and plantation crops such as rubber, coffee,
   coconut, cocoa and cashew. Positive aspects are that the plants create
   a lot of humus and raises pH on very acid soils. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Siam weed. FURTHER INF: It is native of
   tropical, central and south America from northern Argentina to the
   south eastern USA and the Caribbean. It is limited to warm and humid
   tropical regions, latitudes about 30°N and S, and an altitude of about
   1000 m near the equator. It thrives in the regions with rainfall of
   2000 mm and above per annum and temperature range of 20° to 37°C. It
   grows in many soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It does not
   tolerate shade and thrives well in open areas. Flourishes in disturbed
   habitats, particularly in areas of slash an burn agriculture.
