   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An erect, mooth, herbaceous plant that can grow up to
   40-80 cm tall. The plant and seeds have a characteristic strong odour.
   The plant has compound leaves, 7-12 cm long. The flowers are white or
   purplish blue. The fruits occur as pods of 2-10 cm, long, thin and
   pointed and contain 10-20 seeds. USES The seeds are edible and used as
   condiments and as flavoring in artificial maple syrup, cheese and
   curries. An oil can be extracted from the seeds and used to flavor
   butterscotch, cheese, licorice, pickles, rum, syrup and vanilla. This
   oil has potential in the perfume and cosmetic industries. The seeds
   also contain the drug diospenin, used in the synthesis of hormones.
   Seed husks are a source of mucilage, oil, sapogenin and protein.
   Residue is used as manure and fuel. In India, plants are grown for
   forage. GROWING PERIOD Annual, ripens 90-150 days after planting. In
   India, where grown for forage, October plantings are harvested in
   February-March, while January plantings are harvested in April. COMMON
   NAMES Fenugreek, Fenugrec, Helba. FURTHER INF Fenugreek is indigenous
   to southern Europe and western Asia. The expected yield of seed is
   0.5-3.8 t/ha. In India, yields of green forage are about 9-10 t/ha.
   Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.
