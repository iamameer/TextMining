   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree up to 15-40 m in height and with a trunk
   diameter of 50-100 cm. Leaves bipinnate on 2-6 cm long stalks. Pinnae
   10-19 pairs, 5-9 cm long, each with 31-38 pairs of opposite linear
   leaflets, 5-9 mm long and about 2 mm wide. Pods large, 35-55 cm long
   and 3-5 cm wide, straight or more commonly twisted, dangling in small
   bundles, green becoming black. Each pod contains 10-18 large seeds.
   USE: Seeds are sometimes used as a vegetable and young leaves and fresh
   parts of the flower stalks are also edible. Wood is used for paper pulp
   and as timber. The seeds are used in local medicine against hepatalgia,
   oedema, nephritis, colic, cholera, diabetes and as an anthelmintic, and
   also applied externally to wounds and ulcers. The seeds are also valued
   as a carminative. The tree is planted for shade and shelter. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: uâ€špang, petai, chou dou, sataw.
   FURTHER INF: It is a native of the Malay Peninsula, growing wild in
   lowland forests, often cultivated in Malay kampongs. It has been
   cultivated in Java since ancient times. It occurs in scattered lowland
   rainforests and sometimes also in tall secondary forest, on sandy,
   loamy and podzolic soils, also in waterlogged locations, in freshwater
   swamp forest and on riverbanks. The tropical lowland tree requires some
   shade when young.
