   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small semi-evergreen or evergreen tree averaging
   3-10 m in height and about 3.5 m in crown diameter. Leaves
   oblong-obovate, 8-16 cm long and ripe fruit a pseudocarp, broadly ovoid
   or ellipsoid, up to 10-20 x 15-35 cm, dark green and covered with 6 mm
   long soft spines. USES The fruits are eaten fresh or made into
   beverage, preserve, jam, or jelly. Immature fruits can be eaten as
   vegetables. The seeds are reportedly used to treat headlice. The leaves
   have medicinal properties. The roots are employed as a vermifuge.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Growing 3 years before the first bearing. The
   tree may withstand a dry season of up to 6 months. COMMON NAMES
   Soursop, Corosol, Corossol epineux, Graviola, Guanabana, Guanaba, Pinka
   azeda, Thu-rian-khaek, Guyabano, Guayabano, Bayubana, Atti, Guiabano,
   Labanas, Llabanos, Rabanot, Sirsak, Nangka belanda, Nangka seberang,
   Durian belanda, Durian benggala, Durian makkah, Saua sap, Tiep banla,
   Tiep barang, Khan thalot, Khiep thet, Thurian-thet, Thurian-khaek,
   Rain-nam, Mang cau xiem. FURTHER INF Soursoup is native of tropical
   America and the Carribean region. It is the least hardy of the annona
   species and require a warm and humid tropical climate. It can be grown
   in tropical lowlands up to 1000 m and as far as 15°S in sheltered
   sites. It prefer medium to high humidity, but very high humidity
   increases the risk of attacks by pests and diseases. It does not
   tolerate dry cold winds and a minimum day-length of 10-11 hours is
   probably essential for good development. Yields are generally low,
   10-25 fruit of about 1 kg per tree per year, but yields can be much
   higher. In Hawaii an ochard with 215 trees/ha yielded 9.2, 7.6 and 18
   t/ha in the 4th, 5th and 6th year after planting.
