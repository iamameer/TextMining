   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a herb, shrub or small tree reaching a height of
   1-3.5 m, with straggling branches from the base. USE: It is grown as a
   pasture plant, but cattle sometimes avoid it, perhaps because at least
   part of the plant is poisonous. Old stems can be used as fuel. The
   plants are also used for shade (in newly planted perennial crops such
   as citrus, coconut, coffee, rubber and tea, it is grown as a temporary
   shade crop), soil-improvement, reclamation, living fence, and as cover
   crop, green manure and as an ornamentals. It fixes large amounts of
   atmospheric nitrogen and is used in agroforestry systems. Powdered
   leaves are used as an insecticide and bark and roots are used as fish
   poison in India. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. It can flower and fruit all
   year round. Plant last 3-7 years. Two cuttings can be made the first
   year, 3-4 the second, and 4 the third year. COMMON NAMES: White
   tephrosia. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: Cracca candida. White
   tephrosia is native of southeast Asia and India. Its habitat is primary
   and secondary forest, higher locations in sago-palm swamps and
   disturbed places such as roadsides, riverbanks, steep slopes and
   fields. It grows in the seasonally dry tropics and does not tolerate
   frost or waterlogging. Grown on sandy soils in coastal areas and on
   very poor, eroded upland soils and mine spoils where few other crops
   can grow. It tolerates a pH of 3.5-7, the more acidic soils seem to be
   more suitable. In the tropics, it can be grown up to 1650 m in
   elevation. Green manure yields may be about 15 t/ha.
