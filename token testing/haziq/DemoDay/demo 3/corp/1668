   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A slightly pubescent, erect, herbaceous bush or
   twinning vine with well developed tap-root. Stem angular or nearly
   cylindrical, leaves trifoliate and flowers white, pink, lilac or
   purple. Bush cultivars are dwarf plants 20-60 cm tall with lateral and
   terminal inflorescences. Climbing cultivars may reach a length of 2-5
   m. The pods are 10-20 cm long, containing 4-6 seeds or more. USES This
   bean is grown for food. The bean pods are often sold in processed
   forms, usually frozen, canned, or dehydrated. The seeds can be
   processed into dry flour or eaten boiled, baked or fried. They are good
   source of protein, vitamin B, and iron. Immature pods are eaten as
   vegetables. Leaves can be used as a potherb. The plant is used as
   forage. Leaves and fruits have medicinal properties. KILLING T Flowers
   are damaged at 5Â°C or below and the plant is killed by frost. GROWING
   PERIOD Annual, growing 50-90 days for fresh beans, and 90-270 days for
   dry beans depending on variety and altitude. COMMON NAMES Common bean,

   popping type of common bean grown in the Andean mountains are known
   under following names; Nunas, Popping beans, Popbeans, Numia, Nudia,
   Hudia, Kopuro, Chuvi, Poroto, Purutu, Porotillo. FURTHER INF Common
   bean is probably native to tropical South America. It can be found at
   elevations from sea level to 3000 m, most cultivars thrives between 600
   and 2000 m, but cultivars for tropical sea level exist. Popping beans
   are grown between 1800 and 3000 m in the Andean mountains. Common bean
   require medium to high humidity especially at flowering, but to high
   humidity will, like poor drainage, generally result in disease
   problems. Hail can cause serious defoliation and loss of the crop. For
   harvesting, drying and threshing of the beans dry weather is required.
   Photosynthesis pathway C3. To acid soils should be avoided since the
   reduce the activity of the Rhizobium nitrogen fixing bacteria. Common
   bean is not as efficient as many other legumes in utilizing the
   nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria which inhabit the root system. The
   average yield of dried beans is 0.5-1.5 t/ha, but yields up to 2.8-5
   t/ha have been reported. Yields of green pods of up to 5-7.5 t/ha have
   been reported.
