   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An herbaceous vine with a creeping growth habit. The plant
   forms tuberous roots that are mostly located within the top 25 cm of
   the soil. Tubers vary largely in shape, colour and texture. The stems
   form running vines up to 4 m long, usually prostrate and slender, with
   milky juice, lateral stem-branches arising from the short stem are not
   usually branched. The leaves are variable, ovate-cordate, borne singly
   on long petioles, palmately veined, angular or lobed, depending on
   variety, green or purplish. At the end of the vine, trumpet shaped
   hermaphrodite flowers are formed during the summer; they are white or
   pale violet, axillary, funnel-shaped, borne singly or in cymes on short
   peduncles. They are, however, rare, especially in United States. In
   late summer and spring the plant forms round pods with flattened,
   hard-coated, angular seeds and there are 1-4 seed per pod. USES: It is
   cultivated for its edible tubers. They are eaten boiled, baked, candied
   with syrup, or pureed and they are processed like potatoes into fried
   chips, starch, flour, glucose and they can be canned and dehydrated.
   The tubers have a high concentration of carbohydrates in the form of
   sugar and starch. Plant tops and leaves are used as potherbs and the
   vine as a fodder. Greatly esteemed as feed for farm animals; with 3 kg
   green sweet potatoes equivalent to 1 kg of maize, with a food value
   rated 95-100% that of maize. Dry vines a have feed value which compares
   favorably with alfalfa hay as forage The sweet potato is being regarded
   as a valuable raw material for producing alcohol bio-fuel. The leaf
   decoction is used medicinally. KILLING T.: May be damaged below 10°C.
   Very sensitive to temperatures below 1°C for brief periods and 3°C for
   longer periods. GROWING PERIOD: Warm-season perennial herb, cultivated
   as an annual, may be harvested after 80-360 days. A frost-free period
   of 110-170 days is necessary. COMMON NAMES: Sweet potato, Spanish
   potato, Louisiana yam, Patate douce, Artichaut des Indes, Bataat, Zoete
   aardappel, Shaharkuand, Camote, Batata, Batate susskartoffel,
   Skurar-kanda, Mita-alu, Ketala, Rambet, Ubi jalar, Kamote, Uara,
   Kumara, Satsuma-imo, Kara-imo, Imo, Doukali, Dankali, Anamo, Veeazee,
   Viazi viamu, Apichu, Getica, Papas, Mabi. FURTHER INF.: Grown between
   latitudes 40°N and 32°S at elevations up to 2800 m in equatorial
   regions, and otherwise up to about 2000 m. The species is indigenous to
   Central America, and the north-western part of South America. Distinct
   differences between day and night temperatures encourage the formation
   of tuberous roots. A photoperiod of less than 11 hours induces
   flowering, less flowering occurs at 12 hours and none at all at 13
   hours daylight. Above 30°N and S little flowering occurs. Low humidity
   as the crop approaches maturity is beneficial. Vine cuttings are
   usually used for planting or transplants produced by bedding mother
   roots or from rooted cuttings. Optimum yields vary from 17.5 to 27.5
   t/ha depending on the cultivar and growing conditions, while average
   yields are 5 t/ha in Africa, 10 t/ha in South America and 16 t/ha in
   Asia. The world highest production yield at 80 t/ha has been obtained
   in Israel. It is one of only seven world food crops with an annual
   production of more than 100 million metric tons. 1 ton of roots remove
   4 kg N, 1 kg P and 7 kg K from the field. The photosynsthesis pathway
   is C 3 II.
