   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A robust, erect herb, 40-100 cm tall, with a
   pseudostem consisting of the elongated bases and lower blade parts of
   the foliage leaves. USES The 'stem' is eaten as a cooked vegetable and
   as an ingredient of soups. GROWING PERIOD Biennial normally grown as an
   annual. Can be harvested after 120-150 days, but can be harvested over
   a long period of time. COMMON NAMES Leek, Poireau, Puerro, Breitlauch,
   Lauch, Porree, Elephant garlic, Great-headed garlic, Kurrat, Prei,
   Kutsai, Kau ts'ung, Taai suen, Taai ts'ung, Bawang prei, Bawang
   sayuran, Sibuyas-bisaya, Kuse, Khtum, Khchal, Peenz falangx,
   Krathiamton, Krathiam-bai. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: A. porrum.
   Elevations in the tropics of more than 500-1000 m are preferable for
   the production of leeks, but adequate yields may be obtained at sea
   level from local or specially selected cultivars. High temperatures
   encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are
   only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the
   tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher
   elevations, but leek normally does not produce seeds in the tropics. A
   cool period promotes early leaf production, but large plant may be
   obtained at high temperatures if they are well watered. Moist soil is
   required throughout the growing period and growth will continue as long
   as adequate soil moisture is available, but excessive soil water and
   high humidity encourage diseases. Long days normally favour bulb
   development. Leek is considered to be indigenous to Levant in the
   eastern Mediterranean. Average yields in the tropics may be about 5-20
   t/ha or 0.5-2 kg/mÀù and in temperate regions yields may reach 45 t/ha.
