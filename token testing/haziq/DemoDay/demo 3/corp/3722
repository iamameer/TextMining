   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching up to 20 m in height and
   10 m in width at a fast growing rate. It is in flower in April, and the
   seeds ripen from August to September. The scented flowers are
   monoecious and are pollinated by the wind. USE: The inner bark - cooked
   or dried, ground into a powder then used with cereals for making bread
   etc. Sap - raw or cooked. A sweet flavour. Harvested in early spring,
   before the leaves unfurl, by tapping the trunk. A beer can be fermented
   from the sap. Young leaves can be used raw or cooked and used as herbal
   tea. They are anticholesterolemic and diuretic and works as a
   germicides. An infusion is used in the treatment of gout, dropsy and
   rheumatism, and solvent of kidney stones. The bark is diuretic and
   laxative. The inner bark is bitter and astringent, it is used in
   treating intermittent fevers and various skin afflictions, especially
   eczema and psoriasis. The buds are balsamic. The wood is soft, light,
   durable. It is used for furniture, tool handles, carving, toys etc. It
   is a source of charcoal that is used by artists and is also pulped and
   used for making paper. The bark is rich in dye and tannin. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Downy birch, White birch. FURTHER INF:
   It can be found in or at the edge of bogs, in primary and secondary
   woodlands and along sunny edges. It tolerates strong winds but not
   maritime exposure. A pioneer species, it readily invades old fields,
   cleared or burnt-over land and creates conditions suitable for other
   woodland trees to become established. Since it is relatively
   short-lived and intolerant of shade, it is eventually out-competed by
   other trees.
