   Notes
   DESCRIPTION:
   Cactus pear is a perennial shrub up to 3 m tall and it is characterized
   by a shallow, fleshy root system with a horizontal spread. The
   stem-like organs (cladodes) are succulent and typically oblong to
   spatulate-oblong, 30-40 cm long (up to 70-80 cm) and 18-25 cm wide. In
   cross section it is an eustele with a skin, cortex, ring of vascular
   tissue made from collateral bundles separated by parenchyma and pith
   which is the major succulent tissue. The skin is one layer of epidermal
   cells with 6-7 layers of hypodermal cells with thick primary walls
   resembling a laminar collenchyma tissue. The epidermal cells are flat,
   thin and shaped like paving stones. This strong skin helps protect
   against pest and disease attack. The skin is eventually replaced by a
   periderm ("bark") formed from epidermal cells or from cortex tissue
   when injured. The bark breaks off when formed from hypodermis cells.
   The outermost wall of the epidermis, 8-20 mm thick, is impregnated with
   wax containing cutin making the skin surface very water repellent and
   retaining as well as reflecting the sun's rays. True leaves are not
   fully formed but are reduced to spines. When the cladode is young the
   areole forms at the podarium base and this has a green ephemeral
   structure (the 'leaf'); which soon withers and falls. Flowers develop
   in the upper part of 1- 2 year old cladodes and mostly open late
   morning. They consist of numerous fat sepals and many yellow, oval,
   pointed petals. The fruit is an oval or elongated berry weighing from
   100-200 grams. It has a thick fleshy skin or rind; which is 30-40% of
   the total weight. Both mature fruits and spring flushes of new fruits
   may be found on the same cladode. Seeds are small and hard, the number
   per fruit varies from 80 to over 300 and are 5-10% of pulp weight. They
   have a hard lignified coat; which hinders germination. It utilizes the
   CAM path for photosynthesis. CAM plants are generally slow-growing,
   this is not the case for cactus pear. It is hermaphrodite, autogamous
   and actinomorphic with differentiation occurring within 2 months after
   meristem activity. Bees seem to be the major pollinators.
   USES:
   The principal uses are for food and feed. Others include hedging,
   erosion control, medicinal, cosmetic and dyes. The cactus pear features
   widely both in subsistence and niche market agriculture and
   particularly in semi-arid regions where it also plays a soil
   conservation role. It is cultivated in over 30 countries for its
   fruits, young cladodes (as vegetables) and mature cladodes for forage.
   Under optimal conditions 40 t/ha of dry matter can be achieved and
   fruit yields of up to 20 t/ha are feasible. A salad of ?nopalitos?, is
   one of the multiple ways that young cactus cladodes are traditionally
   consumed in Mexico. Dyes: The carmine cochineal develops on cladodes of
   the cactus pear. Both nymphs and adult females suck sap from the
   cladode but do not harm their host plant. The insects secrete a
   powdery, waxy covering; which protects them from their predators. The
   fully grown females are harvested and dried before extraction of
   carminic acid, an excellent natural red dye. NOTE: This cochineal
   species is not to be confused with the biological control agent,
   Dactylopius opuntiae which kills the cactus pear but does not produce
   high levels of carminic acid. Medicine: It has nutritive, diuretic,
   antispasmodic and emollient properties. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial
   shrub, growing 3 years before first harvest. KILLING TEMP.: When mature
   it is frost-hardy to -10^oC for short periods.
   COMMON NAMES:
   Indian fig, Spineless cactus, Prickly pear, Tuna, Barbary fig, Cactus
   fruit, Cactus pear, Turksvy, Figue de barbarie, Indianische feige,
   Frucht des feigenkactus, Fico d'India, Figo da India, Figueira da
   India, Nopal, Chumbo, Chumbera. FURTHER INF.: Indian fig is native to
   tropical America. The national emblem of Mexico is an eagle perched on
   a cactus pear plant. According to legend an Aztec chief announced that
   he would build his capital where an eagle perched. The eagle caught a
   snake and perched on a cactus pear plant. Mexico City was built on that
   spot. It grows over a wide range of soils from vertisols, luvisols and
   feozem in Mexico to lithosols, regosols, cambisols and fluvisols in
   Italy. It is not salt-tolerant. It is drought resistant with one of the
   highest WUEs. A summer rainfall of 300-600 mm is sufficient.
   Multiplication is by vegetative propagation mainly using direct field
   planted single cladodes. Row orientation should be N-S to maximise
   radiation interception if topography permits. Rows 1-1.5 m wide and
   with an intra-row spacing of 0.25-0.5 m is common and 1700 plants/ha is
   the average population density for traditional plantation methods.
   Single or multiple cladodes are planted from 1-3 per hole. Weeding is
   essential as weeds efficiently compete with the shallow-rooted cactus
   pear for water and nutrients. Several types of pruning are used to
   enhance productivity, such as the vase and globe architecture. The
   fruits are delicate and careful hand harvesting is required. A small
   piece of the cladode is cut with the fruit for packing.
