   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herbaceous plant reaching up to 80-150 cm in
   height, with pungent, aromatic leaves. It has a dense root system
   penetrating to a depth of 20-30 cm. The shoots are green, brownish-red
   at the base and lignified. The leaves are 3-8 cm x 0.5-1.2 cm,
   laceolate and shiny. The flowers are yellow or brownish-red. USES The
   leaves are used as flavoring for salad, soups, sauces, pickles, juices
   and meats. The leaves yield an essential oil (estragon oil) used in
   spices, perfumes and liqueurs. The oil also has medicinal properties.
   KILLING T Frost of -15Â°C will not damage the plants even in winters
   without snow, and the late spring frosts will not damage the shooting
   plants either. GROWING PERIOD Perennial herb. Tarrgon lives 8-10 years,
   but plantations are only maintained 3-6 years. The plant can harvested
   twice a year. COMMON NAMES Tarragon, French tarragon, German tarragon.
   FURTHER INF Tarrgon is indigenous to central and northern Asia, the
   Caucasus and the far East. The expected yield of green plants is
   3.5-5.0 t/ha, and 5-8 kg/ha of essential oil in the first year. In the
   following years, the annual yield is 15.0-20.0 t/ha of green plants and
   25-35 kg/ha of essential oil. In the case of dried drug, the average
   yield is 2-2.5 t/ha of herbal drug. Loose sands with no stucture, and
   airless firm soils, or calcareous soils, are not appropriate for the
   cultivation of tarragon.
