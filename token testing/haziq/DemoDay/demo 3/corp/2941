   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A slender, erect, tufted grass with short rhizomes
   or stolons, and with narrow and sharply pointed leaves reaching 20-40
   cm or up to 100 cm in height. USES: Used for pasture and lawns. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Colonial bentgrass, fine bentgrass,
   Rhode island bentgrass, Browntop, Common bentgrass. FURTHER INF: It
   occurs in Europe, northern Asia, United States, Australia, and New
   Zealand. It is found on dunes or sea cliffs to highlands. It is
   extremely resistant to summer heat and winter cold. Its climate
   requirements are thus low. Is present in atlantic or continental
   climates, at low or high altitude. Tolerates shade, for instance on the
   edges of forests. Optimum on normally drained or dry soils. Species
   typical of mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions. Often reveals low
   phosphorus content in soil. Is often associated with Festuca rubra
   which nevertheless prefers slightly richer (mesotrophic) soils. The
   optimum conditions of soil fertility are met on sandy soils, on
   schists, on granits, on gneiss, where the soil reaction is acid, as
   well as on chalk, on dolomites, where the soil reaction is basic.
