   A slow-growing dwarf tree or woody shrub with small dark green leaves
   under natural conditions reaching a height of 5 m. Under cultivation it
   is usually pruned down to 0.5-1.5 m and trained as a low spreading
   bush.
   KILLING T
   Leaves may withstand -5°C.
   GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Harvest of leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a
   maximum at 7-10 years. The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes
   270-360 days to matureand seed are normally produced after 4-5 years.
   The economic life of the plant is about 40 years, but sometimes the
   shrub are kept in production 60-70, or even 100 years.

   FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonyms: C. thea, C. theifera, Thea sinensis, T. bohea, T.
   viridis. China tea can be grown in subtropical lowland up to about 1800
   m and between 750-3000 m in the tropics. Tea origiginates in the
   mountains of Southeast Asia, it is now grown between 40°N and 33°S.
   Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are beneficial. The tree is
   resistant to cold and adverse conditions. To low and to high humidity
   can reduce yields and encourage disease. One ton of tea removes 45-60
   kg N, 4-7 kg P and 20-30 kg K from the field. Yields in Africa average
   between 0.5-2.0 t/ha.
