   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall to very tall tree reaching 45-90 m in height,
   while the trunk may reach a diameter of 200-300 cm. The trunk is
   typically two-thirds or more of the tree height, and of good form. In
   some poor coastal sites it is reduced to a small shrub only a few
   metres tall. Sapwood pale brown, heartwood light brown to brown, with
   open texture, usually with straight grain and fairly well-defined
   annual rings, of moderate hardness and strength. USES The wood is
   easily worked, glued and stained used for pulp production, and for a
   wide range of purposes in construction and manifacture, including house
   building, joinery, flooring, furniture and interior finish. It is one
   of the most important hardwoods of Australia. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES Messmate stringybark. FURTHER INF Messmate occurs on hilly
   or mountainous country. It can in tropical and subtropical regions be
   found at elevations from 200 to 3000 m. The latitudinal range in
   Australia is 28-43Â°S. Annual wood production potential is 18-30 m3/ha.
   The tree is fire resistant.
