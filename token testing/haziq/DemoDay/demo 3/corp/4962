   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A low growning, bulbous herb with grass-like upright
   leaves an bright coloured flower reaching 10-30 cm in hight. USES It is
   cultivated for its fragrant flowers that yield the dye, saffron. The
   dye contains the yellow glucoside, crocin, and is used as a colour
   agent in foods. It is also used as a spice for food and beverage and
   has medicinal properties. The dye can also be used to colour textiles.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Once planted, the corms may remain in the
   field for 3-12 years, but sometimes saffron is grown as an annual crop.
   COMMON NAMES Saffron, Saffron crocus, Safran, Azafran, Kuma-kuma,
   Sapran, Romiet. FURTHER INF Saffron probably originated in Greece and
   western Asia. It thrives best in temperate and fairly dry climates. Two
   periods of rainfall are adequate for good yields, one in the spring for
   the production of new corms and a second in the end of the summer to
   develop blossoms. Frosts and rains during the flowering are harmful and
   can damage the crop. An average yield is about 1.000.000 flowers per
   ha, which in turn produces about 10 kg of dried saffron.
