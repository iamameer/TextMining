   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A glabrous mat-forming grass reaching 25-75 cm in
   height. USES It is used for turfing lawns, airstrips, erosion control
   and as a pasture grass. KILLING T It has some frost-resistance. GROWING
   PERIOD Warm-season perennial. COMMON NAMES Carpet grass, Mat grass,
   Compressum, Durrington grass, Narrow-leaved carpet grass. FURTHER INF
   Carpet grass is native of southern United States, Central America and
   the Caribbean. It is often found on low, flat, and wooded areas.
   Because it has such a dense sod and aggressive growth, it is difficult
   to maintain legumes with it. Maximum top growth have been recorded at
   day-lenghts at about 15 hours, while the highest seed production occurs
   at 12-14 hours. It will flower in day-lenghts between eight and 16
   hours. It is tolerant of frequent defoliation. Dry matter yields are
   usually between 0.8-5.2 t/ha. It can become a weed, especially on soil
   of low fertility.
