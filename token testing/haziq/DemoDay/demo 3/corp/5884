   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized to tall tree, which under favourable
   conditions can reach 30-40 m in height, while the trunk may reach 200
   cm in diameter. The bole is about one-half of the tree height and the
   crown is relative open. Heartwood dark red to reddish brown, hard,
   coarse-textured, strong, durable and termite resistant. USES The wood
   is used for heavy construction, either in the round or sawn, piling,
   sleepers, ship building and bridge and wharf construction, as well as
   for all purposes in house construction, including beams, rafters and
   flooring. The wood finishes well and is used for the manufacture of
   high quality furniture. Flowers are used for producing honey. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Jarrah. FURTHER INF Jarrah is one of the
   most important hardwoods of Australia. In Australia, the latitudinal
   range of the tree is 30-35Â°S and it thrives at elevations between
   100-300 m. It usually forms forest or woodland on gravelly soils, but
   sometimes also on sand or loam. (pH estimated by the compiler).
