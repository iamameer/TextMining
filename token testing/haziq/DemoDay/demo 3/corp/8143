   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A grass and cereal crop up to 60-180 cm tall, with a
   shallow root system and erect culms. Indica rices are usually tall,
   leafy, high tillering, and lodge easily. USES Rice is mainly grown for
   food but it is also used in cosmetics, laundering starch, and textiles.
   An oil is produces and used as cooking and salat oil, for soap
   manifacture and it is made into a plastic packaging material. Husks are
   used as fuel, as an addition to concrete, for making hardboard and as
   an abrasive. Straw are used for fodder and as a fertilizer. Beer, wine
   and spirits can be produced from the grain. GROWING PERIOD Annual
   grass, wetland types growing 80-150 days, while floating rice may
   require 180-200 days to mature. COMMON NAMES Rice, Riz, Arroz, Reis,
   Ris. FURTHER INF The cultivation of indica is confined to areas between
   0° and 25° latitude, it is seldom grown above 1200 m in elevation and
   perform best below 600 m. They are hardy, resistant to diseases and
   tolerate unfavourable growing conditions. Rice can be grown very
   successfully in areas of low humidity and rainfall if there is adequate
   water available for irrigation but rice prefer medium to high humidity.
   Photosynthesis pathway C3 II. Rice in this group flower fastest when
   the day-length is 10 hours or less and even day-length of 12 hours will
   delay the flowering. Rice seedlings is only adapted to a water pH down
   to 4.0. In tropical Africa average yields vary between 1-3 t/ha.
