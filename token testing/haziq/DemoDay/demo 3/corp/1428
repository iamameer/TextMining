   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Erect or ascending, much-branched glabrous perennial,
   30-90 cm, with alternate trifoliate leaves; leaflets, 30 mm, narrowly
   obovate, toothed in upper third with a mucronate tip; stipules
   linear-lanceolate, usually serrate. Numerous stems originating from
   crown buds; as the stems develop, axillary buds formed in lower leaf
   axils produce further stems, which build up a crown of basal buds at
   their base. The crown is the main source of stems produced after
   defoliation; axillary buds above ground develop into branches. It is
   deep-rooted, 2-4 m, or more in deep, well-drained soils. About 60-70%
   of total root mass is in the upper l5 cm of the soil profile.
   Inflorescences are compact racemes up to 40 mm, borne in axils of upper
   leaves; purple florets, 8 mm, typically papilionacious.
   Cross-pollinated by various species of bees. Seedpods are spirally
   coiled, glabrous or pubescent; pods turn from green to brown as they
   mature, and contain 2-5 kidney-shaped, yellow or brown seeds. A
   proportion of the seeds are hard, probably inversely related to
   temperature during seed set. USES: It is one of the highest yielding
   forage legumes and requires deep, well-drained fertile soils to
   maximize its potential. The inherent growth characteristics and good
   yield response to infrequent cutting make lucerne a highly suitable
   species for conservation as hay or silage. It is mainly grown as a
   fodder crop. Chlorophyll is extracted from the leaves and the flowers
   are a source of honey. It is grow as a cover crop to reduce erosion. It
   is a nitrogen fixer and estimates of annual rates range from 85 to 360
   kg N/ha with a wide variation among sites. It can be grown in
   combination with maize for silage. Its fibers can be used in the
   manufacture of paper. It has medicinal properties and a yellow dye and
   trypsin inhibitors can be extracted from the seeds. It is compatible
   with non-aggressive grasses. KILLING T.: 0^oC during early growth and
   it is known to survive temperatures of ˆ25^oC in Alaska and above 50^oC
   in California. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, lasting up to six years, but
   usually three to four years, growing 100-365 days per year. Spring to
   autumn, but main flush of growth in late spring/early summer. It is
   variable in winter dormancy. Winter-hardy types suited to cold regions
   have a longer dormancy period and shorter growing season than the less
   winter-hardy types suited to warm temperate regions. COMMON NAMES:
   Alfalfa, lucerne, sativa, blue alfalfa, common purple lucerne, common
   lucerne, purple alfalfa, purple medick, luzerne, alfacah, amara, bersim
   hadjazi, fecad, fesefca, kefiz, mendidjel, nefel, n'fel, rottba, sefca,
   safsafa, sofsfa, berseem hegaazi, gaddooh, qadaab, qadb, qarad, bersim
   hedjazi, fussa, barsim hijazi, duhrayjah, fussah, kutat, galeria,
   thua-anfanfa. FURTHER INF.: Widely distributed in temperate zones of
   the world, e.g. USA, southern Canada, Europe, China, southern Latin
   America and South Africa. The autotetraploid alfalfa originated from a
   diploid species, native to an area south of the Black and Caspian Seas.
   Alfalfa can be found up to 4000 m in elevation in Bolivia, but normally
   up to about 2400 m. In warm climates relative humidity should be low;
   hot and humid conditions promote diseases. The seed needs to be
   inoculated with an effective strain of Rhizobium meliloti, which
   requires a soil pH of at least 6.0. Lime-coated, inoculated seed has
   been used with success on more acid soils. More drought tolerant than
   other forage legumes such as red clover or birds foot trefoil.
   Deep-rooting ability is an important factor in drought tolerance and
   any adverse soil physical or chemical conditions, which restrict root
   growth will reduce drought tolerance. Compared with many forage species
   lucerne is an efficient user of water supply largely as a result of its
   deep taproot system. During severe drought, plants become dormant but
   resume growth when moisture becomes available Dry matter yields may be
   10-20 t/ha. Seed yields vary from 50 to 750 kg/ha.
