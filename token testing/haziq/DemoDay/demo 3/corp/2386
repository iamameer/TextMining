   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small deciduous tree reaching a height of about
   6-10 m. The leaves are pinnate, leathery and with 3-7 leaflets. The
   fruit is a narrowly ovoid to oblong or subglobose, one-seeded drupe,
   1-2 cm x 0.6-1.2 cm, with a light green kernel. USES The tree produces
   edible nuts used in the food industry as flavoring and colouring for
   cakes, ice cream, snack foods and certain confections. Oil from the
   fruit has medicinal properties. The wood can be used for small items
   like agricultural tools, spoons, etc. Resin tapped from the stems is
   used in high quality paints, nitro-lacquers and also has medicinal
   properties. Galls and fruit pericarp is employed to dye silk. KILLING T
   Can survive winter temperatures down to -10 to-18°C. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial, growing 4-5 years before first bearing, 7-10 years to reach
   commercial production and peaking at about 20 years. The tree can live
   for several hundred years, 700 years have been recorded. COMMON NAMES
   Pistachio nut, Fustuq, Pistachio, Pista, Piste, Fistashka. FURTHER INF
   Pistachio nut is a native of western Asia. It require low to medium
   humidity and needs a period of 1000 hours below 7.5°C in the winter to
   break the rest period of the buds. In Iran and Syria, it can be grown
   up to about 1200 m in elevation. Pistachio can withstand a very dry
   air, but excessive dampness and high humidity is unfavorable to its
   development. It is grown in regions with a hot dry season with daily
   mean temperatures of 30°C for 3 months. Yields alternate with a heavy
   crop followed by lighter crop in the next year. A 4-5 year old tree may
   yield about 23 kg of nuts.
