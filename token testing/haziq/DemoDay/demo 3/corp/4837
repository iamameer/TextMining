   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Evergreen palm up to 35 m tall and 1 m in diameter,
   normally 6-12 m tall. Leaves 5-10 cm long; leaflets 2-4 pairs, opposite
   or semi-alternate, petiolulate, elliptic ovoid, 2-6 cm long, 1.2-2.5 cm
   broad with finely pinnate reticulate nervation. Flowers in terminal
   racemes to compound panicles with numerous, sub-sessile whitish
   flowers. Sepals 4 - lanceolate, concave, firm, glabrous outside,
   pubescent inside. Petals absent. Stamens free, (8-10), the anthers
   elliptic, versatile. Ovary hirsute; briefly stipitate; fruit ovoid,
   compressed, ca 2 x 3 cm, coriaceous, with one large seed partially
   covered with a thick aril. USES: The oleoresin called Œcopaiba‚ can be
   obtained by drilling a 5cm deep hole into the trunk, which is then
   closed with a bung. Every 6 months or so, the bung is removed and 15 to
   20 litres of a hydrocarbon collected. The wood of the tree is
   honeycombed with a network of connected cavities in which the oleoresin
   forms. To tap the tree, a drainage reservoir is hollowed out near its
   base by cutting inward and downward into the centre of the trunk. The
   cavities containing the oleoresin gradually drain into these
   hollowed-out wells. This process is repeated several times during the
   season. When first obtained, copaiba is thin and clear but on aging
   becomes thicker and acquires a yellowish tinge. This liquid can be used
   as a diesel substitute and is used in lacquers, massage preparations,
   medicines, and paints. Wood and resin can be used for fuel. The wood is
   used in carpentry. FURTHER INF.: It occurs from subtropical dry to wet
   through tropical dry to wet forest life zones. Copaiba probably
   tolerates annual precipitation of 1000 to 4000 mm, annual temperature
   of 20 to 27°C (with no frost), and pH of 4.5 to 7.5. Early USDA
   publications suggest that most copaiba comes from regions with annual
   precipitation of 3500 mm or more and annual temperature ca. 27°C.
