   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a fairly fast-growing deciduous tree reaching 12-30
   m in height and 1.8-3 m in trunk diameter. The bole may be 12-18 m with
   very thin, rough and slightly fissured bark. Leaves 5-foliolate,
   leaflets obovate 5.5-1.7 x 3.2-8.5 cm. Fruit ellipsoid, 13-16 mm long,
   green at first, becoming soft and black when mature, the hairy calyx
   persisting. The inner nut usually has 4-5 seeds. USE: The fruit is
   edible but usually eaten only in an emergency. The timber is hard and
   durable, very pale and similar to teak. The heartwood of trees over 60
   cm in diameter is often dark and very decorative. It works easily and
   is used for cabinet work, panelling, veneer, furniture and coffin
   boards and also as firewood. The tree is planted as a windbreak and
   ornamental. Fallen leaves make a useful mulch. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Meru oak. FURTHER INF: It can be found in
   moist evergreen forest and on thicketed rocky hills. Prefers deep
   sandy-loam soils.
