   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized deciduous, spineless tree,
   usually 4-18 m but may reach 30 in height. With one or more straight
   trunks 50-100 cm in diameter. Often with a thin, V-shaped crown. Where
   it is heavily browsed it becomes a rounded shrub. Shublike and more
   branchy in dry areas. USES The wood is used as mine timbers,
   fenceposts, house poles, bridge timbers, railway material, carved
   ornaments, parquet, furniture, and firewood and charcoal. Extracts from
   wood and roots have medicinal properties. It is browsed by livestock
   and provides fodder. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. The
   mopane worms, hairless caterpillers, can be used as food. KILLING T It
   withstands only mild frosts, heavy frosts may cause the branches to die
   back. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Butterfly tree, Balsam
   tree, Mopane, Mopani, Musaru, Lipani, Turpentine tree, Rhodesian
   ironwood, Mopanie, Mupani, Sanya. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym:
   Copaifera mopane. Butterfly tree occur naturally within the latitudinal
   range of 10°N-25°S. It is a lowland species and can be found between
   sea level and 1200 m. The optimum altitude is below 900 m. It is very
   shallow rooting, and can therefore survive on low mounds in wet areas,
   or under saline conditions as long as salinity in the topsoil is low.
   It thrives only where there is little competition from deep-rooting
   trees. The tree coppices vigorously after fire, frost or felling, it
   fixes nitrogen, is very drought hardy, and casts little shade.
