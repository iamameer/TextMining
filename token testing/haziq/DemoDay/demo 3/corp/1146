   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small to medium-sized deciduous or in humid areas
   evergreen tree with an open form reaching a height of 5-15 m and a
   trunk diameter of 30 cm. The trunk is twisted or grows at an angle.
   Flowers are 2 cm long, pink with yellow and white. USES Timber used for
   posts, rural house construction, railway crossties, furniture, farm
   implements, and tool handles. It is often planted as a living fence. It
   is utilized for green manure, cattle forage, firewood, and planted in
   firebreaks, windbreaks, and for shade and reforestation of denuded
   land. Trees are used for shade in cacao and coffee plantations and for
   support of vanilla and black pepper vines. Seeds are used as rat
   poison. Fresh crushed leaves have medicinal properties. KILLING T Light
   night frost is tolerated, but not prolonged frost. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. Early seedling growth is slow, but once established, growth
   is fast (up to 3 m per year). Pods ripen 40-55 days after flowering.

   Mother of cacao is native of the seasonally dry Pacific Coast of
   Central America and Mexico from sea-level to 1200 m. It can be found at
   elevations between sea level and 1600 m, but is most common below 500
   m. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 6-19Â°N. It
   is common on plains, foothills, and lower mountain slopes. Leaves are
   toxic to horses and most other animals except cattle. Roots, bark and
   seed are toxic to man. The tree is fire resistant, it fixes nitrogen
   and it require wide spacing. In woodlots, the first harvest can be
   taken after 3-4 years, giving wood yields of 8-15 m3/ha. Subsequent
   coppicing is done every 2-3 years and yields may be 11-21 m3/ha. In
   fodder plots, dry matter yields may be 9-16 t/ha or up to 43 t/ha of
   fresh material.
