   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a long-lived, perennial, aquatic, colonial,
   rhizomatous herb reaching 1.2-1.5 m or even 3 m in height. It has long,
   slender, and green stalks topped with brown, fluffy, sausage-shaped
   flowering heads (spikes). The staminate and pistillate portions of the
   spike are separated by 1-8 cm of bare stem. The spike is medium to dark
   brown. USE: All parts of the plant are edible; the leaves can be used
   in weaving of mats etc; all parts of the plant have medicinal
   properties and the plant is used for waste water treatment. GROWING
   PERIOD: Long-lived perennial. COMMON NAMES: Small reed mace,
   Narrow-leaved cattail, Lesser bulrush. FURTHER INF: It is found in or
   near water, in marshes, ponds, lakes, and depressional areas. It is an
   obligate wetland indicator plant species. It tolerates perennial
   flooding, reduced soil conditions, and moderate salinity. It will often
   form an almost complete monoculture in boggy soil and may form floating
   mats. It grows in water or poorly drained soil. It thrives in rich
   soils but is of shallow soil, all types of soil textures and medium
   salinity. With influxes of nutrients or freshwater, it is an aggressive
   invader in both brackish salt marshes and freshwater wetlands. It can
   be found throughout North America, Eurasia, southern Scandinavia and
   northern Africa.
