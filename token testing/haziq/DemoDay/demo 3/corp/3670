   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is usually a rambling, many-stemmed shrub or small tree
   reaching 4-8 m in height, the branches often drooping. Bark grey and
   smooth. Leaves deeply divided for almost half their length, with a
   small apical appendage between the lobes; each lobe is oval to almost
   elliptic, most often small about 2.5 x 2.5 cm, but may be up to 8 cm,
   pale fresh green. Flowers bell-shaped, up to 7 cm long, beautiful and
   distinctive. USE: Leaves are used to manufacture a yellow dye. The
   dried leaf, flower bud, seed and bark are used medicinally. Th root
   bark is used internally for conditions of the large intestine, while
   the flower is used as a remedy for dysentery and diarrhoea. The fruit
   is said to be diuretic, and the seed is eaten in India as a tonic and
   aphrodisiac. A decoction of the root bark is used as a vermifuge, and
   an infusion made from the stem bark is used as an astringent gargle. An
   infusion of the root bark is used as an external application to
   inflamed glands, abscesses and skin conditions, while the fruit is said
   to be diuretic and an infusion of the rind is used as an astringent
   gargle. It makes a good hedge plant and a non aggressive ornamnetal.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: bell bauhinia, hairy bauhunia,
   orchid tree, St. Thomas tree, yellow tree bauhinia (English). FURTHER
   INF: It can be found from South Africa, northwards to tropical Africa
   and Ethiopia and eastwards to Sri Lanka and India. In South Africa, it
   grows in forest, bushland and the coastal dune bush. It also occurs in
   low-altitude woodland, often forming part of the riverine thickets, and
   on the forest edges. In Zambia, it grows in thickets and on stream
   banks and rocky slopes of the central and southern provinces and the
   Luangwa Valley. Trees grow in the shade or in full sun, can withstand
   light frost and are somewhat drought hardy.
