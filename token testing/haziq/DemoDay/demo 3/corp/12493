   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is hairy, rough, perennial, herbaceous plant reaching
   75-150 cm in height and 50-60 cm in width. Stems and leaves exude a
   milky sap when cut or bruised. One plant can form a large clump by its
   spreading rhizomes. Leaves opposite, 15-20 cm long, velvety,
   gray-green, persistent. The fragrant, hermaphrodite flowers look like
   crowns or stars, with the {{corolla}E} reflexed and rose-purple and
   hoods elevated above the corolla in pinkish-white to pinkish-purple,
   aging yellow. The fruits are rough seed pods (5-8 cm long) which split
   open when ripe releasing their numerous silky-tailed seeds for
   dispersal by the wind. USE: The flowers, gum, leaves, seed and seedpod
   are edible whereas the rhizome is poisonous. Dye, fibre, latex, oil,
   paper, pollution control, and stuffing can be obtained from the plant.
   It has medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   Showy milkweed, Common milkweed. FURTHER INF: It grows in clumps beside
   roadways, on abandoned farmlands, dry habitats, dry slopes,
   construction sites, logging landing fills, open woodland areas, waste
   areas and along streams and other open and disturbed areas. In western
   N. America it can be found from Minnesota to British Columbia, south to
   Kansas, Utah and California.
