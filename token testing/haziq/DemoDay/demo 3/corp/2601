   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A shrub or medium-sized tree. On wind-exposed coastal
   dunes it develops into a 2-3 m tall shrub, on better protected sites it
   may become a tree of 5-20 m and on very favourable sites it may reach
   30 m. Tall trees may reach a trunk diameter of 50 cm. USES The wood can
   be used for heavy construction, furniture, boatbuilding, flooring,
   hardboard, poles, veneer, and fuel. The tree can be used for
   revegetation and fixation of coastal sand dunes, shelter, and shade.
   GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial. It may reach a height of 4.4 m
   and a diameter of 4.2 cm at 1 year old. COMMON NAMES Northern wattle,
   Papua New Guinea red wattle. FURTHER INF Northern wattle occurs along
   the northeastern coast of Queensland, Australia within the latitudinal
   range 8-20Â°S at elevations from sea level to 200 m. It can also be
   found in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. It is commonly found right
   behind the beach, on flat land or on sand dunes and on coastal plains
   and foothills. It is nitrogen-fixing and tolerant of fire and salt
   winds.
