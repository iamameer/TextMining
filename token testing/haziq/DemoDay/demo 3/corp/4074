   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree reaching 12-45 m in height and
   0.5-1.8 m in diameter, with a dense crown and abundant white flowers.
   USE: The fruits are good food for hogs. The attractive wood is similar
   to mahogany and has similar uses. Oil has been extracted from the
   seeds. The resin called balsámo de maría, has been used medicinally. In
   the Caribbean, it is planted as a shade tree for coffee and cacao and
   for windbreaks. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: false mamery
   (English). FURTHER INF: It is widely distributed throughout the
   Caribbean. In Puerto Rico, it grows in the sub-tropical moist forest.
   In Nicaragua, the species is found in lowland evergreen rain forest. In
   the lower mountain rain forests of the Chiapas, Mexico, it is one of
   the canopy trees. It occurs in nearly all soil types. It seems to grow
   best on wet, humid, sites, but also grows well on pure sand and rock
   sandstone. In Puerto Rico, it occurs naturally on the north coast on in
   sandy soils of the orders inceptisols, oxisols and alfisols. It has
   been planted on deep clays and serpentine soils in the mountains, and
   in shallow limestone soils near the coast. It does well on degraded
   sites, and is resistant to salt. In Jamaica, it occurs on volcanic and
   metamorphic shales.
