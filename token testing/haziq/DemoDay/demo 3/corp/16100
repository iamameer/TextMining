   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is deciduous tree reaching 25-30 m in height. It
   requires wide spacing. USE: The lightweight, rather soft wood is used
   primarily for core stock in manufacturing furniture and for pulpwood.
   It is frequently planted to give quick shade near homes and is suitable
   for soil stabilization where soil and moisture conditions are adequate,
   as along stream or ditch banks. GROWING PERIOD: It is a relatively
   short-lived but fastest-growing perennial. COMMON NAMES: Carolina
   poplar, Eastern cottonwood. FURTHER INF: It grows best on moist
   well-drained sands or silts near streams, often in pure stands. It
   grows on deep, infertile sands and clays but makes its best growth on
   moist, welldrained, fine sandy or silt loams close to streams. The
   soils of most cottonwood sites are in the soil orders Entisols and
   Inceptisols. It can in tropical and subtropical regions be found at
   elevations from 300 to 3000 m. P. deltoides var. deltoides can be found
   within the laditudinal range 28-51°N and P. deltoides var. occidentalis
   within 33-54°N. Annual wood production potential is 20-40 m3/ha.
