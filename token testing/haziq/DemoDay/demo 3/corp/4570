   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   Harvest of superior bark cannot usually take place until the trees are
   at least 10-12 years old. Bark of young branches are harvested. USE:
   The bark is peeled from stems and branches and set aside to dry. Some
   varieties are scraped. While drying, the bark curls into quills. The
   colour varies from light reddish brown for the thin, scraped bark to
   grey for the thick, unscraped bark. Ground cassia is reddish brown in
   colour. Cassia from China is less aromatic than that from Vietnam and
   Indonesia. Cassia from all three countries has a sweet, aromatic, and
   pungent flavour. Vietnamese, or Saigon, cassia is particularly highly
   esteemed. The buds, the dried, unripe fruits have a cinnamon-like aroma
   and a warm, sweet, pungent taste akin to that of cassia bark. The whole
   buds are added to foods for flavouring. COMMON NAMES: Saigon cassia,
   Saigon cinnamon, Cassia. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: C.
   aromaticum. Saigon cassia is native of Vietnam. The bark contains 1 to
   7% of essential oil.
