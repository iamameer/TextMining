   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching 5-10 m in height with a
   spherical top and a short trunk with low branches. Crown is rounded,
   with the branches ascending and then curving downwards. Leaves
   trifoliate, leaflets cuneate at the base and with irregular and bluntly
   toothed margins, waxy grey-green above with a sparse covering of hairs,
   lighter in colour and more densely hairy below, up to 4 x 2.5 cm, the
   middle leaflet larger than laterals. USE: Roots of young plants are
   juicy with a mildly sweet taste and can be chewed. The gum is also
   eaten and the bark is brewed to make a red tea. The leaves are browsed
   by livestock, especially camels and goats, at the end of the dry season
   when the tree comes into leaf. It is of outstanding importance for many
   nomadic herdsmen in the northern parts of the Sahel. Fruits are chewed
   or pounded and used against toothache and diseases of the gum. It is
   suitable for planting for live fences and hedges. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: African myrrh. FURTHER INF: A widespread
   species, although its range and ecology is somewhat obscured by
   taxonomic confusion. It is common in Acacia-Commiphora bushland and is
   normally found in dry savannahs and in the Sahel. Occurs in a wide
   range of soil types including red dolerite, sand, rocky escarpments,
   boulders, clays, and lateritic crusts. It appears to grow best on
   calcareous soils, sands, red clay and sandy clay the Sahel. It is fire
   and fairly termite resistant.
