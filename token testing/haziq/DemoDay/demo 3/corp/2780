   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A deciduous tree reaching 20-60 m in height. The stem is
   cylindrical, free of branches for up to 3/4 of its total height. Even
   above its massive plank buttresses, it can achieve a diameter of over
   200 cm. The roots penetrate up to 4.5 m into the ground. USE: The
   foliage can be used as fodder. It is a good source of nectar. The wood
   is not very durable. Optimum annual wood production is 0-10 m3/ha. It
   is easy to work with tools and is well suited for turnery, carving and
   polishing. Also used as fuel. The tree is used for erosion control on
   riverbanks and to stabilizing terraces, for shade, shelter and as
   windbreak, and for reforestation. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. In
   southern India the flowers appear in November-January, when the tree is
   leafless. The fruits ripen in April-June. COMMON NAMES: Shingle tree,
   Indian ash, Mandania, Handige, Havalige, Malaikonnai, Balanji, Yetama,
   Mayahnin. FURTHER INF: It can be found at elevations between sea level
   and 1500 m. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of
   23-27Â°N. Normally adapted to regions of heavy rainfall. The tree
   requires wide spacing. It grows best in submontane areas in the humid
   and subhumid tropics with a short, dry spell. It is very sensitive to
   frost. Rare in Sumatra and Java, where it occurs on fertile and
   constantly wet soils in the forest, sometimes on abandoned agricultural
   land. In Thailand, it occurs in evergreen gallery forest and is more
   frequent in India and Myanmar. It is a pioneer and demands light, but
   it can tolerate slight shade when young.
