   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A deciduous tree or erect shrub reaching 10-35 m in
   height with a deep taproot, pale bark and broadly umbrelliform crown.
   Young trees and lower branches are armed with thorns. USES The bark can
   be extracted for tanning used in the leather industry. The bark is also
   used to prepare a beverage (arak) and its fibres are used for fishing
   nets. The wood is used for indoor constructions, furniture, firewood
   and charcoal. The germinated seeds can be consumed cooked and the stem
   and roots produce a gum with medicinal properties. Pods and foliage are
   used as fodder. The tree is also planted for soil improvement and fire
   protection. It is mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. The leafs fall for a short period at the beginning of
   the rainy season and the tree flower at the end of the rainy season.
   COMMON NAMES Pilang, Opilan, Pelang, Ta-noung, Chalaep daeng, Phayaa
   mai, A bu, A kawa. FURTHER INF Pilang is native to large parts of South
   and South-East Asia. It occurs in regions with a pronounced East
   Monsoon at elevations between sea level and 550 m. It need good space
   to develop into a mature tree. Bark production for tanning may be 8-80
   kg/tree, whereas the wood production may be about 15m3/ha (whole tree),
   11 m3/ha (thick wood) and 9 m3/ha (clear bole). (pH & TEMP estimated by
   the compiler).
