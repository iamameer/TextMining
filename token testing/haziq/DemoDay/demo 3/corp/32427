   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an unbranched palm growing up to 20 m tall,
   characterized by a crown up to 8 m wide. Trees over 25 years old have a
   swelling of the trunk at 12-15 m above the ground (at 2/3 of the
   height). The bark is pale grey in older palms and is more or less
   smooth. Leaves very large, fan shaped, bluish-green, 15-30, up to 3.5 m
   long. USE: The fruits have a large, fibrous pulp (around 500 g each)
   that smells strongly of therbenthine. They are consumed raw or cooked,
   preferably with rice. The kernels contain an albumen, which before
   ripening is sweet and refreshing. The immature seeds can be eaten and
   contain a sweet jelly that has a refreshing taste. The mature seeds can
   be buried in pits and allowed to germinate, and the shoots are said to
   be a delicacy. Fruit and leaves are used as fodder. The wood is used as
   firewood and charcoal. Oil can be extracted from the fruit. The palm is
   planted as an ornamental and as firebreak. It is appreciated because of
   its sap, tapped from flower spikes, which ferments to palm wine.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: African fan palm, borassus
   palm, palmyra palm, ron palm (English). FURTHER INF: Distributed in the
   Guineo-Congolian and Sudanian savannahs, It is abundant and
   characteristic in all types of savannah of the region, occurring at low
   altitudes along rivers and in coastal woodlands. It can tolerate high
   temperatures and will grow in areas with rainfall less than 500 mm/year
   if the groundwater table is high. It is often in dense stands. The palm
   can serve as an excellent firebreak, especially in the arid regions of
   West Africa, which are prone to wildfires. It is usually found in
   sandy, well-drained soils, but prefers alluvial soils near
   watercourses.
