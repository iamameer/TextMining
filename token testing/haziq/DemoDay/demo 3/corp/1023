   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized evergreen tree usually attaining
   heights of 20-30 m, but in Hawaii some specimens have reached 55 m. The
   trunk can reach diameters up to 100 cm. The trunk is typically straight
   and about 1/2 the tree height. The crown has long, spreading, irregular
   branches. USES Timber is used for constructions in contact with the
   ground, underground piling, poles, and fenceposts. It makes a good
   fuel. The tree is planted for shade, windbreaks, and as an ornamental.
   It is a source of honey. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Can be grown on
   35-50 years rotations for timber-wood. Withstands droughts of up to 4
   months. COMMON NAMES Swamp mahogany, White mahogany, Australian brown
   mahogany, Swamp messmate, Robusta, Beakpod eucalyptus, Brown gum, Red
   gum, Robusta eucalyptus, Australian swamp mahogany, Eucalipto del
   alcanfor, Eucalipto de pantano, Eucalipto comun, Eucalipto achatado.
   FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: E. multiflora. In Australia, the tree
   can be found at elevations between sea level and 100 m, elsewhere up to
   1600 m. The natural latitudinal range in Australia is 23-35Â°S. The
   species is indigenous to a narrow coastal belt from Queensland to south
   of Bega, New South Wales, Australia. The tree is best adapted to moist
   conditions and it has a restricted topographical range, mainly
   occurring in swamps and on the edges of saltwater estuaries and
   lagoons, or rarely on the lower slopes of valleys. The normal annual
   wood production potential is 14-28 m3/ha, in Brazil, Chile, and
   Madagascar the optimum annual wood production have been recorded to 35
   m3/ha. The tree tolerates salt winds and it can regenerate rapidly.
   However, the top break readily in strong winds.
