   Notes
   (26.07.02) E9096
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree, ranging in height from 6-25 m and
   in diameter from 0.3-1.2 m. Open-grown crowns are broad and dense, with
   foliage often reaching the ground. Trees in dense stands generally have
   irregular crowns and few lower branches. In closed stands trunks may be
   branchless up to 6 m high. The tree may develop deep taproot but most
   individuals has a shallow root system. USE: The acorns are edible. It
   is used as an urban ornamental tree, can be used in rehabilitation
   projects and provides cover and feed for wildlife. The wood is mainly
   used as fire wood. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Stands are typically from
   40 to 110 years old. Individual trees may live over 250 years. COMMON
   NAMES: coast live oak, encina, California live oak. FURTHER INF: It
   occurs especially along the coast in California and northern Mexico. It
   occurs in a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet winters
   and hot, dry summers. Trees generally occur on mesic sites such as
   north slopes, alluvial terraces, canyon bottoms, or upper streambanks.
   It is exceptionally fire resistant, more so than other California oak
   species.
