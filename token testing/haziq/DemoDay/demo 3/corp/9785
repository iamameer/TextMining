   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: The mature (evergreen) tree attains a height of 25-27 m
   and a stem diameter of 40-50 cm, often with a clear, cylindrical bole
   to 9 m. The crown is narrow, with a width averaging 4-6 m, and a crown
   width-to-dbh ratio of 22:25. It develops a shallow root system often
   suitable to mountain soils. Leaves dark green above; oblong, and often
   notched or smooth at the apex. The specific name glauca means covered
   with a bloom, which refers to the bluish-green foliage; it is derived
   from the Greek work glaukos (bluish). USES: Seeds contain 60-75% edible
   oil that can be extracted by conventional methods. Each well-grown tree
   yields 15 to 30 Kg nutlets equivalent to 2.5-5 kg oil and about the
   same quantity of oilcake. This amounts to 1000-2000 kg oil/ha/year and
   about the same quantity of oilcake. The oil is largely used in the
   preparation of bakery products in Central America. In India too it can
   be used in the manufacture of vanaspati, vegetable oil and/or
   margarine. The oil is free from bad cholesterol. It can be also used
   for industrial purposes in the manufacture of bio-fuels, soaps,
   detergents, lubricants, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc. The
   oilcake being rich in nitrogen (8%), phosphorus (1.1%) and potash
   (1.2%), is good organic manure. The shells can be used in the
   manufacture of particleboard, activated charcoal or as fuel. The fruit
   pulp, rich in sugars (about 11%) can be used in the preparation of
   beverages. The pulp and leaf litter can be economically used in the
   manufacture of vermicompost (about 8 tons/ha/year). The wood is
   generally insect resistant and is used in the preparation of furniture,
   toys, as pulp (in paper making) and as fuel. The flowers are a source
   of honey. The residual cake left after processing the crude fat from
   the seed contains a toxin. All parts of the tree are used for medicinal
   purposes. The bark is taken as a decoction or tea for diarrhoea and
   fever. Leaves are used for rheumatism or are applied in the form of a
   lotion for body pain, bruises or skin itch. This eco-friendly tree with
   a well-developed root system and with evergreen dense canopy
   efficiently checks soil erosion, supports soil microbial life, and
   improves groundwater availability. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: Creole: bwa blan, bwa fwenn, doliv, fwenn, English: bitter ash,
   bitter damson, princess tree, simarouba, French: bois amer, bois blanc,
   bois Frêne, bois négresse, quinquina d?Europe, Spanish: acajou blanc,
   daguilla, daguillo, gavilan, juan primero, laguilla olivio, palo
   amargo. Trade name: simaruba. FURTHER INF.: It is shade tolerant and
   occurs as an under-storey tree, particularly under the canopy of large
   fruit trees where birds perch and deposit the seeds. It is found as an
   associated species of the subtropical moist forest, sharing a position
   with other common trees of the home and humid perennial gardens, such
   as mango (Mangifera indica), royal palm (Roystonea borinquena), avocado
   (Persea americana) and plantain (Musa x paridisiaca). The species does
   poorly on severely degraded sites and approaches the limits of its
   optimal range in regions receiving less than 1200 mm of water. It is
   found on rocky, shallow calcareous soils of mountain slopes and ridges,
   as well as on the deeper soils of the ravines and alluvial plains.
