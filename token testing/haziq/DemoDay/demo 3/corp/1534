   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herbaceous or woody shrub-like plant reaching a
   height of up to 2-3 m. When young the plant has a rosette-like growth
   habit, but later produces a stout, erect main axis about 1.5 m tall.
   The stem bears large, simple, ovate leaves arranged spirally. The
   leaves vary in size, thickness and texture. They may be up to 50 cm
   long and the number of leaves is about 20-30. The nicotine content is
   highest in the uppermost leaves. USES The leaves are cured and dried
   and used for tobacco cigarettes and cigars, snuff, and as a source of
   nicotine for insecticides. KILLING T Very sensitive to frost and the
   duration of the frost-free period is an important production factor.
   Have been recorded to tolerate -3°C. GROWING PERIOD Annual, or
   short-lived perennial. Normally grown as an annual. Growing 40-60 days
   in nursery, about 70-120 days from transplanting to harvest in the
   tropics and 100-150 days in temperate climates. COMMON NAMES Tobacco.
   FURTHER INF In the tropics, tobacco can be grown at elevations between
   800-1800 m, and it can be grown between 60°N and 40°S. In advanced
   stages of growth the tobacco leaves can be severely damaged be hail,
   heavy rain or strong winds. The crop require dry weather when the
   leaves are maturing, but a prolonged dry period in this period may
   cause secondary growt
