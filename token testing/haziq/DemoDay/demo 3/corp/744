   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: The coconut is an evergreen palm, in strict botanical
   terms it is not a tree. It has no bark, branches, cambium or secondary
   growth. It is a woody, perennial monocotyledon and its trunk is a stem,
   which grows to about 25 m and exceptionally 30m; dwarf selections also
   exist. Being a monocotyledon the coconut has no taproot and
   adventitious roots develop continually from the bole. Roots may spread
   from the bole in any direction and at any angle below the horizontal
   for up to 10 m or more, depending on soil and water supply. The m ain
   roots are about 10mm in diameter with secondary and tertiary branches.
   When young they are coloured white to cream and have a very sharp
   tipped growing point below a loose root cap about 12mm long. There are
   no root hairs. The rate of elongation is not uniform and the root takes
   on a banded appearance as it matures and its colour darkens through
   shades of orange. When growth eventually ceases the root is brown with
   a tip that is rounded and blunt. The smallest branches are about 1-2mm
   in diameter and are short lived and frequently replaced. Where they
   occur at, or in wet conditions sometimes above, ground level the
   secondary and tertiary roots remain as very small, peg-like
   pneumatophores, or "breathing roots". It has a smooth, columnar, light
   grey-brown trunk, with a mean diameter of 30-40 cm at breast height,
   and topped with a terminal crown of leaves. Trunk slender and slightly
   swollen at the base, usually erect but may be leaning or curved and
   marked with leaf scars.. Leaves pinnate, polymorphic, feather shaped,
   4-7m long and 1-1.5 m wide at the broadest part. Leaf stalks 1-2 cm in
   length and thornless. The inflorescence consists of female and male
   axillary flowers. Flowers small, light yellow, in clusters that emerge
   from canoe-shaped sheaths among the leaves. Male flowers small and more
   numerous. Female flowers fewer and occasionally completely absent;
   larger, spherical structures, about 25 mm in diameter. Fruit roughly
   ovoid, up to 15-25 cm long and composed of a thick, fibrous husk
   surrounding a somewhat spherical nut with a hard, brittle, hairy shell.
   The nut is 2-2.5 cm in diameter and 3-4 cm long. Three sunken holes of
   softer tissue, called ?eyes?, are at one end of the nut. Inside the
   shell is a thin, white, fleshy layer known as the ?meat?. The interior
   of the nut is hollow but partially filled with a watery liquid called
   ?coconut milk?. The meat is soft and jellylike when immature but
   becomes firm with maturity. Coconut milk is abundant in unripe fruit
   but is gradually absorbed as ripening proceeds. The fruits are green at
   first, turning brownish as they mature; yellow varieties go from yellow
   to brown. USES: Food: Copra, the dried coconut endosperm, contains an
   edible cooking oil (coconut oil). The apical region of C. nucifera
   (?millionaire salad?) is a food delicacy in areas where it is grown.
   Other food derivatives of coconut include coconut chips, coconut jam,
   coconut honey, coconut candy and other desserts. Fodder: Copra meal and
   coconut cake, the residues of oil extraction from copra containing
   approximately 20% protein, 45% carbohydrate, 11% fibre, fat, minerals
   and moisture, are used in cattle feed rations. Apiculture: C. nucifera
   is an important pollen source for honey production. Where sap is tapped
   from unopened inflorescences for toddy-making, many bees drain in the
   collecting pots. The honey may be greenish-yellow like the motor oil
   and crystal clear if monofloral. Granulation is medium (takes up to 3
   months). Fuel: The high moisture content of C. nucifera wood and the
   difficulty of splitting it has made it relatively unpopular as
   firewood. Coconut shell charcoal is a major source of domestic fuel in
   the Philippines. It is also exported to Japan and the USA. Coconut oil
   can be used as a substitute for diesel oils, for electric generating
   plants and motor vehicles. Fibre: Three types of fibres are obtained
   from the coconut husks: mat fibre or yarn fibre, used in making mats;
   bristle fibre, used for brush making; and mattress fibre, used in
   stuffing mattresses and in upholstery. Leaflets are used in braiding
   mats, baskets and hats. Timber: C. nucifera timber has traditionally
   been used in tropical countries for the structural framework of houses.
   Coconut timber taken from the lower and middle parts of the trunk can
   be used for load-bearing structures in buildings, such as frames,
   floors and trusses. Coconut trunks can be used for poles, as they have
   great strength and flexibility. The wood can also be used for furniture
   and parquet flooring. Lipids: The oil contains fatty alcohol and
   glycerine used in soaps, detergents, shampoos cosmetics,
   pharmaceuticals and explosives. Alcohol: Sap from the tender, unopened
   inflorescence (coconut palm sap) is used in the producing areas for
   toddy, or tuba, a beverage obtained by natural fermentation. Tuba
   contains 6-7.5% alcohol. The distillation of fermented coconut toddy
   yields a spirit called arrack, produced commercially in Sri Lanka and
   the Philippines. Other products: Coconut-shell flour, obtained from
   grinding clean, mature coconut shells to fine powder, is used as a
   filler in thermoplastic industry and an abrasive for cleaning
   machinery. Coconut-shell charcoal may be processed further into
   activated carbon that has many industrial applications, including
   general water purification, crystalline sugar preparation and gold
   purification. The edible mushrooms of the genus Auricularis grow well
   on coconut stems and are readily sold in China and elsewhere. Soil
   improver: Burnt husks form a useful sort of potash that is used to
   fertilize the trees. The husks also make valuable mulch for moisture
   conservation in the dry season and help to suppress weeds. Ornamental:
   Planted widely as an ornamental tree. Intercropping: Coconut palm is
   one of the most widely grown tree crops in the tropical countries. Its
   growth characteristics are ideal for small production and also for
   combining with other crops. The crown morphology and the relatively
   wide spacing facilitate the planting of a wide spectrum of field crops
   in coconut plantations. It has therefore been intercropped with cereals
   (cassava, sweet potatoes, yams) or fruits (bananas, passion fruit,
   pineapples and ground nuts) in many countries including Thailand,
   India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines etc. KILLING T.: Will withstand a
   small amount of frost. The lowest temperatures tolerated for long
   periods are for palm 10°C, for leaves 15°C, and for flowers 20°C.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering begins at 5-7 years, (dwarf
   varieties 3.5-4.5 years). The palm reaches full bearing after 10-12
   years, maturity at about 15 years and lives up to between 60 and 100
   years in the wild state, and 50-70 years under cultivation. There is a
   360-365 day yield cycle. The inflorescence is initiated 16 months
   before the spathe opens and the nut takes about a year to mature from
   the time of pollination. COMMON NAMES: Coconut, Cocotier, Cocotero,
   Kokospalme, Palma de coco, Cocotero, Cocoteros, Narel, Nariyal,

   FURTHER INF.: The coconut palm probably originated from the Melanesian
   region. It is generally grown within 26°N and S and the most suitable
   climates are found between 10°N and S. For good yields coconut requires
   small temperature differences between day and night, because of this it
   is normally grown no higher than 700-950 m above sea level even at the
   equator. It can though be found up to 1500 m in a few areas near the
   equator. Areas where drainage is poor are not satisfactory unless the
   water rises and falls frequently, as is the case near a tidal estuary.
   The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Normally 84-97% relative humidity is
   required for good production, 63% is about the minimum for production
   and the monthly mean should not fall below 60%. It is popularly known
   as ?Tree of Life?, ?Tree of Heaven?, ?Kalpaviriksha?, ?Tree of
   Abundance?, ?Natures? Supermarket? and is grown in more than 93
   countries in an area of 11.85 million ha with production of 10.39
   million tonnes of copra equivalent. It sustains millions of small
   holders for their livelihood. It also supports large number of
   coconut-based industries and thereby the millions of labourers, both
   men and women are solely depending on this crop. It is associated
   socially, culturally and religiously in many parts of the world.
   Coconut and its products including coconut oil is consumed in more than
   120 countries.
