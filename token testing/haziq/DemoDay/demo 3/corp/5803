   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree, usually reaching 5-15 m in height,
   with a well-branched, rounded, spreading crown. The trunk is short and
   the bark yellow-buff when fresh, otherwise grey-brown to creamy brown,
   deeply grooved, thickly corky and often spiny; when damaged the tree
   exudes a brown, gummy sap. Leaves compound, trifoliolate, alternate;
   leaflets almost as broad as long, 5.5-15 x 6-14 cm. Fruit a
   cylindrical, woody pod, 4-16 cm long. USE: Leaves are used as fodder
   and the flowers provide bees with forage. Wood is used for small
   implements and fuel. The bark and roots yield useful dyes. Bark, stem,
   leaves and roots have medicinal properties. The tree can be used for
   erosion control on stream banks and terraces. It can be grown for shade
   and is often combined with annual crops, especially when it is grown in
   rotation with coffee or cocoa. Also grown as an ornamental and living
   fence. It can fix atmospheric nitrogen and the leaves make a good
   mulch. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: lucky-bean tree,
   red-hot-poker tree. FURTHER INF: It is the most widespread species in
   Africa, found in savannahs throughout eastern and southern Africa. As
   with many trees in areas with frequent fires, the young trees establish
   a deep root system before stem growth. It grows well in most climates
   but not in dry or high areas. It does not grow in forests.
