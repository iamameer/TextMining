   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A woody, evergreen, left-winding liana, sometimes
   over 16 m long with compound leaves with 7-15 leaflets. The roots are
   up to 2 cm in diameter and up to more than 2 m long and dark
   reddish-brown. USES The powdered root, or extract, is used as an
   insecticide against horticultural pests like lice and caterpillars and
   against external parasites like ticks, lice, fleas and flies of animals
   and man. It is also used as a fish-poison. GROWING PERIOD Perennial.
   Often harvest after 24-27 months. It can survive dry periods of up to 4
   months. COMMON NAMES Tuba root, Luba patch, Derris, Tuba patch, Touba,
   Tuba, Tuba akar, Kayu tuba, Tuba kurung, Tuwa leteng, Oyod jelun,
   Mombul, Manengop, Tubli, Tugling-pula, Upei, Hon, Ca bia, K'biehs, Hang
   lai daeng, Lai nam, Kalempok, Giaythuoc ca, Giay hay. FURTHER INF Tuba
   root is native of South East Asia. It is best adapted to low altitudes,
   but has been reported up to 450 m in Puerto Rico and up to 1500 m in
   Java. It is often found at forests edges and on riversides. There is
   danger of erosion during the first few months after planting and again
   after harvesting, land suitable for this crop should therefore be flat
   or only slightly sloping. Leaves are said to be poisonous enough to
   kill cattle. Yields of air-dried roots varies with cultivar and
   cropping method, in the trailing system it may be between 0.5-2.5 t/ha,
   while up to 3 t/ha can be produced if the plants are trellished.
