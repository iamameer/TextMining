   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An evergreen bushy shrub or small tree reaching as high as
   3-4.5 m on well-watered sites. USES: Jojoba produces oil and wax from
   its fruit capsules and brown nuts. The oil is used in cosmetics, drugs,
   plastics, waxes, and leather. The wax is used as a lubricant in
   linoleum, detergents, pharmaceutical products, polishes, and carbon
   paper. The flibert-flavored nuts are cured and eaten from the shell.
   The seed meal is a source of concentrated vegetable proteins. The plant
   also make attractive clipped hedges and slope covers. KILLING T.:
   Seedlings may tolerate -5째C, and older plants -9째C. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. It begins to bear after 3-5 years and thereafter fruit
   annually. The plant come into full bearing in 7-8 or 10-12 years, and
   bears for 100-200 years. Fruits mature 90-180 days after fertilization.
   COMMON NAMES: Jojoba, Goat-nut, Jojowi, Bucknut, Coffee nut, Pig nut,
   Lemon leaf. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: S. californica, S.
   pabulosa. Jojoba thrives best in areas of low humidity and it is
   drought hardy. Wind affects the shape and habit of growth and it often
   only reach a height of 0.6-0.9 m because of the harshness of its
   environment. Jojoba can be grown from sea level or from 300 to 1500 m
   in elevation. The origin of jojoba is obscure but the present wild
   distribution is limited to northern Mexico and southwestern United
   States between 23 and 35째N. A temperature drop to around 15째C for a
   period of about 2 months is necessary to break the dormancy of the
   flower buds. Seed yields can vary between 0.5-15 kg per tree. Mentioned
   as a useful agroforestry species. Average yield obtained from planted
   stands of jojoba is 2.25 t/ha, or about 1.5 kg/plant annually.
