   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION An evergreen shrub or small tree up to 3-10 m tall.
   The trunk is slender to 20 cm in diameter, frequently with low drooping
   branches and root suckers. Fruits are spherical to pyriform berries 3-8
   or up to 13 cm in diameter. The skin color is yellowish green to
   orange. USES The fruits rich in vitamine C can be eaten raw or used in
   the preparation of paste, jelly, preserves, and juice. Guava powder is
   made from the dehydrated fruits. The wood is used for tool handles,
   implements, fenceposts, and firewood. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species. KILLING T Frost may damage the tree, but it can
   sprout again from the ground. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Bear fruit
   after 2-3 years, is in full bearing at 7-8 years and with an economical
   life of 15-30 years, or even up to 40 years. Fruit mature about 120-150
   days after flowering. It withstands 4-6 months of drought. COMMON NAMES
   Common Guava, Lemon Guava, Xalxocotl, Goyave, Guajava, Guayabe,
   Guayaba, Goyavier, Amrud, Safari am, Goiaba, Guayabo, Araca guacu,
   Bayabas, Guayabas, Bagabas, Bayauas, Bayobo, Biabas, Gaiyabat, Gayabit,

   America. It can grow both in climates where there are long hours of
   full sunshine and under more tropical humid conditions with many clouds
   and heavy rainfall, but fruit quality is poor in areas of high rainfall
   or high relative humidity. It can be grown at altitudes from sea level
   to 1300-1800 m in the tropics, but commercially the crop should be
   grown below 800-1000 m. The seeds are spread by birds and in some
   places it has become a troublesome weed of pastures. Average yields of
   fruit from improved trees may be between 12-15 t/ha and 50 t/ha have
   been obtained. In India, 8-10 year old trees from seedlings may produce
   400-500 fruits per year while grafted trees at the same age may produce
   1000-2000 fruits.
