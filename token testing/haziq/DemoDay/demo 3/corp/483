   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, much-branched, broad, bushy tree reaching
   5-12 m in height with compound leaves, composed of 2-5 pairs of
   leaflets. The fruit is 7.5-12.5 cm in length, oval or elliptic, and
   ribbed longitudinally with 3-5 prominent and sharply angled ribs. USES
   Ripe fruits are juice and aromatic. Sweet types are usually eaten
   fresh, in salads, and in drinks, while sour varieties are used for
   jelly, tarts, or pickles. The fruit may be used for cleaning brassware.
   KILLING T Young trees are killed at 0 to -2°C, mature trees may
   withstand -2°C for short periods and -3 to -6°C for few houres. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. Clonal trees may bear in 2-3 years, seedlings after
   5-6 years. Flowering continues throughout the year and fruit is
   available for most of the year but usually there are one or two
   pronounced harvest seasons, each lasting about 2 months. Fruit
   development takes about 60-100 days. COMMON NAMES Carambola, Averrhoa,
   Star-fruit, Five corner, Coromandel gooseberry, Carambole, Carambolier,
   Pomme de Goa, Kamrakh, Cumrunga, Groseille de coromandel, Blimbing
   manis, Balinbing, Spo, Fuang, Ma fueang, Khe. FURTHER INF Carambola is
   probably native to the humid tropical South-East Asia. It is well
   adapted to hot humid conditions, but prefer a climate with a dry season
   and can be grown up to 500 m in elevation. The growth can be extended
   to the frost-free subtopics and it is grown within the latitudinal
   range from 32°N-30°S. It requires permanent shade and wind breaks are
   recommended on exposed sites. Five year old trees may produce up to 50
   kg per tree per year, while more mature trees (8-13 years old) may
   produce between 90 to 300 kg per tree per year, or 14-80 t/ha.
