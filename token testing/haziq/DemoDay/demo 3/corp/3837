   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree 8-25 m (max. 28) high with a flat crown. It
   is evergreen in good years and on the more favourable sites, and
   deciduous in dry conditions. Branches are heavy, thrusting upwards and
   outwards, often twisting and curving, giving the tree beautiful shape
   and balance. Leaves are pendulous, dark green, oblong-elliptic, 2.5-8 x
   1-4.5 cm, with 2-7 but usually 4 pairs of opposite or nearly opposite
   leaflets. Flowers are small and greenish. USE: Leaves are browsed by
   livestock and the flowers are a source of honey. The wood is used as
   firewood and charcoal. The bark is astringent, containing 13% tannin.
   An infusion of the root provides treatment for dysentery and diarrhoea.
   A decoction is applied as an eyewash for conjunctivitis. The trees are
   famous for the attractive pink, wine red, copper and bronze colours of
   their spring foliage and are a suitable species for amenity areas and
   with its flat crown it provides good shade. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Bean-pod tree. FURTHER INF: It occurs in deciduous
   woodlands on ridges and escarpments. The trees associate with most
   woodland species and occupy gaps in coastal forests and thickets. They
   are dominant or codominant with Julbernardia globiflora in woodland,
   most frequent at medium to high altitudes. In Kenya, the species occurs
   naturally in Kwale and Kilifi Districts on sandy soils 20-40 km inland
   and south of the Tana River. This is the most widespread species of
   Brachystegia in Zimbabwe and Mozambique and is dominant and
   ecologically important over large areas of its range, occurring in
   open, deciduous woodland. Trees are susceptible to frost. It tolerates
   a wide range of soils, develops best on moist, deep, red soils and
   usually avoids poorly drained and shallow soils.
