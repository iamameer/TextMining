   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree usually reaching 10-15 m in height but can
   become 26 m tall. The crown is rounded and the trunk short, spiny
   (spines 1-2 cm long), much branched, sometimes buttressed to 2 m. Bark
   brownish-grey or olive-brown, flaky. Leaves alternate, trifoliate.
   Inflorescence racemose, terminal, appearing when leaves are present,
   with pale brick-red or salmon flowers. USE: The young leaves are eaten
   as a vegetable in Java and Bali, and the flowers in Guatemala. Leaves
   are used as fodder. The presence of ant-repellent compounds in the
   nectar has been reported. The bark is used as a poultice on fresh
   wounds, and bark or root decoctions against beriberi. It is planted as
   a shade tree in cocoa and coffee plantations, for reforestation, as
   living fence and as an ornamental. Where rainfall is irregular and
   sometimes below 1000 mm per year, it has been noted to persist in
   prolonged drought without losing its leaves, recirculating nitrogen,
   phosphorus and potassium from prunings. It is therefore a promising
   species for agroforestry systems in such areas where it would be
   intercropped with maize and cassava. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: coral bean, purple coral-tree. FURTHER INF: It is a pioneer
   species, most commonly found on the outer margins of swamps on sites
   that are not permanently flooded. It seems to prefer littoral locations
   with badly drained soils like swamps and stream banks and upland
   riverine marshes. In an experiment, it has shown good performance in
   acid soils of pH 4.3 and aluminum saturation of 80%.
