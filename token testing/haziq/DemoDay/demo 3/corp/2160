   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A vigorous, climbing woody, deciduous vine up to 15-20 m
   long, but in cultivation drastically pruned. Fruit a berry, ellipsoid
   to globose, 6-25 mm long, dark blue-purple, red, green or yellow,
   juicy, sweet or sour. USES: Fruits are eaten raw or dried, pressed for
   juice, fermented as wine, or made into jams and jellies. Residue from
   pressed grapes is fed to livestock or used to make tannin and cream of
   tartar. Grape seeds yield a drying oil used for lighting, paints and
   cooking. Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable. KILLING T.: Dormant
   vines may withstand -12°C to -20°C, new shoots and leaves are damaged
   at 0°C to -5°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, may be harvested after
   160-180 days for early cultivars, and 190-270 days for late cultivars.
   COMMON NAMES: European wine grape, Raisin, Uva, Weintraube, Vindrue,
   Grapevine, Table grabe, Vigne, Weinrebe, Vite, Videira, Vina, Traube,
   Grappe, Buah anggur, Anggur, Ubas, Sa-pyit, Trapeang, Baay chuu,
   'Angunx, Angun, Nho. FURTHER INF.: The European wine grape is belived
   to have originated in the area between the Black and the Caspian seas,
   where it still grows wild. It is predominantly grown between 20-50°N
   and from 20-40°S but it can also be grown in the tropics at altitudes
   between 300 and 2000 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3. A sheltered, warm
   situation, and a long warm, or hot and dry summer is best, and the
   plants grow most satisfactorily when the winter is sufficiently severe
   to ensure a period of complete dormancy each year. High humidity and
   rainfall during the growing period favours diseases and tends to
   produce low quality grapes, 60-80% relative humidity is optimum. Light
   requirements are high, but only the leaves should be exposed and at the
   same time shield the fruits against the sun. Reported yields are
   between 10-90 t/ha.
