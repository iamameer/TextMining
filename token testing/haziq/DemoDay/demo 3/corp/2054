   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium to tall deciduous tree usually 25-30 m tall
   and 1 m in trunk diameter. However, under favorable conditions the tree
   can reach a height of 50 m and a diameter of 2 m. On good sites it
   often develops a tall clean cylindrical bole buttressed at the base.
   USES The timber is very strong and of high quality, remarkable for its
   constancy under changes of temperature and moisture. It is used for
   ship decks, bridges, wharves, railway carriages, wagons, shingles,
   wheels, carving, general carpentry, veneer, plywood, poles, fence
   posts, fuel and charcoal. Leaves, seeds and bark have medicinal
   properties. Leaves contain some tannin and bark dye. It is used for
   reforesttation and mentioned as a possible agroforestry species.
   KILLING T Usually teak may not withstand 3°C, but in some places, in
   the northern part of its geografical occurrence, it is recorded to
   tolerate mild frost. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. It can be grown with a
   rotation period of 30-60 years. On good sites with deep soils it may
   withstand a dry season of 4-6 months. COMMON NAMES Teak, Tec, Teca,
   Sagun, Sagwan, Sag, Tegu, Tegina, Teku, Thekku, Kyun, Yati, Ajate,
   Dati, Djati, Jate, Hadlajate, Dalanang, Kalayati, Sagunyate. FURTHER
   INF Teak is native of Southeast Asia. It is usually found on hilly
   terrain but it may also occur at plains and alluvial flats at
   elevations from sea level to 900 m. The latitudinal range of natural
   occurrence is 10-25°N. Teak often leads to soil erosion in pure stands.
   Young trees should be protected against high winds. The tree is fire
   resistant when mature. Annual wood production potential is 6-18 m3/ha.
