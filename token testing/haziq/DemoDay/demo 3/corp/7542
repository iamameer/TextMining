   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A small, erect, much-branched herb reaching a height
   of 25-50 cm. Young shoots are greyish-green, and hairy, older parts of
   the stem are balding, and reddish-brown. The flowers are small, white
   or greenish-pink. USES The leaves are used to flavor meat dishes and as
   a herb tea. Oil can be extracted from the leaves and used as a
   flavoring, it has medicinal properties and is also used in cosmetics
   and scented articles. The plant is grown as an ornamental. KILLING T
   Young plants may tolerate -2°C temporarily. GROWING PERIOD Annual or
   perennial growing for 4-5 years but in northern Europe often renewed
   annually. COMMON NAMES Sweet majoram, Majoram, Knotted majoram. FURTHER
   INF Scientific synonym: Origanum majorana. Sweet majoram is native of
   North Africa, eastern India and the eastern coastal regions of the
   Mediterranean. The drug yield of marjoram is highest when the water
   content is 60% of the water-holding capacity of the soil. Cool, cloudy
   weather just prior to budding results in smaller yield and lower
   essential oil content. Average yield is 1.5-1.8 t/ha of dry, shelled
   drug.
