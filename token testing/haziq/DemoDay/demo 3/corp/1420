   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An erect shrub with an upright woody stems reaching a
   height of 4 m or more. The mature tuber may measure 1 m in length and
   weigh up to 2 kg. The cassava plant may be divided into two main parts:
   the shoot system, which consists of stem, leaves and reproductive
   structures or flowers; and the root system, which consists of feeder
   roots and tubers. The fleshy elongated tuberous roots or rhizomes, are
   very woody, only slightly thickened in wild varieties; under
   cultivation up to 2.5 m long and 10-15 cm in diameter, weighing up to
   40 kg, averaging 4-7 kg; leaves usually deeply 3-7-parted with
   spatulate to linear-lanceolate acuminate lobes 7.5-15 cm long,
   glabrous, glaucous beneath and minutely puberulent along veins, long
   petioled; flowers in panicles, less than 1.2 cm long; capsules globose,
   about 1.2 cm across, with 6 winged angles; seeds 3 per capsule. USES:
   Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor families, because
   of its high starch content. With minimum maintenance, the farmers can
   dig up the starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 years
   after planting. Thus, people can cultivate cassava during times of
   conflict or natural disaster when no other food is available. The
   tubers have a high content of carbohydrates, phosphorous, iron, and
   calcium and are a valuable source of food. Cassava starch is used in
   cooking and cassava flour is used in puddings, biscuits and other
   confectionary. In Africa, people also eat the leaves of the cassava as
   a green vegetable, which provide a cheap and rich source of protein and
   vitamins A and B. (Young leaves are cooked like spinach). Various
   industries use it as a binding agent, because it is an inexpensive
   source of starch. Cassava starch is used in the production of paper and
   textiles and as monosodium glutamate (MSG), an important flavoring
   agent in Asian cooking. In Africa, cassava is beginning to be used in
   partial substitution for wheat flour, thus providing income to
   resource-poor farmers and saving foreign exchange for national
   Governments. The plant is also used in the production of adhesives,
   cosmetics, textiles, and paper. It is fed to livestock. Alcoholic
   beverages and ethanol for fuel are made from the tubers. The advantage
   of cassava for ethanol production is that the tubers may be stored in
   the ground for many months before processing; thus extending the
   factory window. KILLING T.: May not tolerate 7째C for prolonged periods
   and it is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived
   perennial. Mature leaves may be harvested 50-70 days from insertion of
   the cuttings. The 'sweet' cassavas mature in 180-270 days, the 'bitter'
   in 12-18 months. Growing period 6-24 months, depending on cultivar and
   conditions. COMMON NAMES: Cassava, Manihot, Manioc, Tapioca, Guacomote
   Yuca, Cassave, Kelala, Marachini, Maravalli, Simul Alu, Ubi Singkong,
   Mangahazo, Ubi Kayu, Mun Sumpalung, Boodin, Kaspe, Katela, Bodin, Obi
   Kajoe, Poohoong Kahoy, Kamoteng, Tentu Neskok, Muk Shue, Pok Fung,
   Cassada, Aipi, Aipim Ubi, Ketalla, Macaxiera, Mandioca, Manoco, Ramu,
   Yautia. FUTHER INF.: Cassava is seldom grown above 1800 m in elevation
   in the tropics, maximum elevation for successfull cultivation is about
   1000 m. Latitudinal range is 25째N to 30째S. Maximum tolerated slope is
   about 5째. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 II. Prefers moderate
   humidity. Tuber production is delayed and reduced in daylengths greater
   than 10-12 hours. Cassava is native to the countries between the Amazon
   region and southern Mexico. World production for 2004 was estimated at
   204819995 metric tons. Production in Asia during the same period was
   60492789 metric tons and in Africa 108974574. Area harvested in 2004:
   World 18051574 hectares Brazil 1754875 Congo 1842559 Indonesia 1255805
   Nigeria 3531000 and Mozambique 1068500 hectares. Yields from small
   holders average 5-15 t/ha, but yields of up to 30 t/ha can be obtained.
   Scientists at two CGIAR research centers IITA and CIAT have developed
   elite varieties of cassava with improved qualities. IITA has discovered
   spontaneous polyploids in cassava, which are characterized by enormous
   vigor and variation in form and structure. Selections from triploids
   "super cassava" have doubled the yields of existing improved varieties
   with normal chromosome numbers. IITA has also introduced to Africa a
   wider genetic base for cassava improvement, focusing on materials with
   resistance to mites, mealybugs, cassava bacterial blight, tolerance to
   drought, low cyanogen potential, and good cooking quality. Together,
   IITA and CIAT launched a biological control campaign of the mealybug
   and are cooperating with the International Fund for Agricultural
   Development (IFAD) in the formulation of a global development strategy
   for cassava.
