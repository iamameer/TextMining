   forming dense mats. Leaves trifoliolate, with leaflets round, 1-7 cm
   long and 1-4 cm wide. Inflorescences are axillary racemes, with 2-5
   (-10) white, yellow or blue flowers. Pods (9-) 13-20 (-30) mm long and
   4.5-5.5 mm wide. USE: Used in intensively grazed pastures, and forms a
   good ground cover in lightly shaded areas. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: Creeping vigna. FURTHER INF: Native of the upland tropics
   (1000-2700 m) of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
   Also suitable of subtropical lowland areas. Occurs in grasslands,
   grasslands with scattered trees, thickets, forests and sometimes as a
   weed of cultivation. Often forms a natural mixture with grasses such as
   kikuyu, producing excellent grazing. It can be found in areas with from
   1000 mm to more than 2500 mm annual rainfall and with average annual
   temperatures between 17-27Â°C. It occurs on soils with textures ranging
   from sands to medium clays with pH from 4-7. These soils are often
   infertile and have at least moderate levels of soluble aluminium. It
   requires good soil moisture for performance, but can survive up to a
   few months of dry conditions. It tolerates waterlogged soils, but is
   intolerant of flooding. DM production about 1-4 t/ha/year.
