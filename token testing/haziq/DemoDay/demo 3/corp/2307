   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An evergreen tree (palm) reaching 10-20 m in height,
   shallow rooted, with multiple trunks, about 10-30 cm in diameter,
   covered with thin spines, pinnate leaves about 3 m long, fruits 2-5 cm
   in diameter in large clusters, each with thick pulp, and one large seed
   or seedless. USES: The fruit is eaten boiled in salted water, ground
   into flour, or fermented and made into a beverage called chicha. Fruits
   and seeds of the more oily types are used to extract oil. The fruit or
   residues from processing makes a good feed for poultry and pigs. The
   kernels are oily but edible. The palm also produce the palm heart.
   Immature inflorescences may be eaten in a similar way as the fruit. The
   trunk is utilized as ornamental wood and smaller items. The soft part
   of the stem may be used to make liquor. A cellulose may be produced for
   cellophane paper and rayon. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to flower
   when 3-4 years old, and its economical life is about 75 years. Fruit
   bunches mature in about 180 days, and two crops are usually harvested
   per year. For production of palmhearts it can attain harvests size in
   18-30 months and thereafter be harvested every 9-15 months. COMMON
   NAMES: Peach palm, Pejibaye, Palm chestnut, Paripou, Pejibay,
   Pejivalle, Palmier-peche, Contaduro, Chontaduro, Chonta, Pejiballe,
   Pejivalle, Macanilla, Piriguao, Pirijao, Pupunha, Palma piva, Macana,
   Cachipay, Tembe, Pixbae, Pixbay, Cachipay, Macana, Comer, Tembe.
   FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: Gasipaes chontadura, G. microcarpa,
   G. utilis, G. macana, G. ciliata, Guilielma gasipaes, G. speciosa.
   Peach palm is native of the humid lowlands of Central and northern
   South America. In Costa Rica, it is grown at altitudes between sea
   level and 1500 m, but yields are reduced at elevations above 700 m. A
   second harvest is sometime possible at low altitudes. In Bolivia it is
   found at elevations between 200-2000 m, in Ecuador between sea level
   and 1000 m. It occurs on slopes too steep for cultivation. It require a
   humid climate with not more that 2-3 months of dry season. Young
   seedlings may require partial shade for fast establishment, but the
   palms grow best in full sunlight. Fruit yields may be as high as 10-30
   t/ha, but are often only about 2-3 t/ha and yields of 50-100 kg per
   trunk per year are not unusual. For palm hearts the yield ranges from
   4000-10000 hearts/ha per year.
