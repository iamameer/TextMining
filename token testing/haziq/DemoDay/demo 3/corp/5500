   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A tall tree reaching a height of 40-50 m, the bole
   often branchless for 30 m or more, cylindrical and with a girth of up
   to 6 m, buttresses small to large, rounded. USES The timber is used for
   medium to heavy constructions but it is not very durable in contact
   with the ground. When treated with a preservative the timber can also
   be used outdoors. Because of its resinous nature it is less suitable
   for flooring and woodwork exposed to the sun, or to be painted. It is
   used for veneer, plywwod, paper pulp and charcoal. An oleo-resin can be
   extracted and used as a coat for waterproofing paper, as a varnish for
   boats, walls and furniture. The oleo-resin and also the bark of the
   tree have medicinal properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES
   Dhali garjan, Sil garjan, Keruing kesat, Keruing keladan, Wuluk bulan,
   Damar kacawai, Keruing kesat, Keruing kesugoi, Pannau, Aganan, Lalian,
   Kanyin, Kanyin-ni, Yang-sian, Yang-daeng, Yung-hua-waen. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: D. pilosus, D. marginatus and D. vernicifluus.
   Dhali garjan occurs in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Andaman Islands and parts
   of India. It is usually found on hills but can also grow in more flat
   country at elevations between sea level and 800 m. It can withstand
   shade in youth. Yields are about 30-60 m3/ha/year. (pH estimated by the
   compiler).
