   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium sized to tall tree reaching 10-35 m or even
   40 m in height, while the trunk may reach 50-150 cm in diameter. The
   tree varies from a small mountain shrub to one of the largest acacias
   in Australia. Small trees are often branched from the ground, while
   large trees have a well developed straight trunk. Sapwood white and up
   to 10 cm wide, heartwood golden-brown to dark-brown, growth-rings
   distinct, not tough, grain usually straight but sometimes wavy and very
   decorative. USES The wood is used for sliced veneer, especially on
   particle board, for cabinet work and furniture. It takes a high polish.
   GROWING PERIOD Perennial evergreen tree, growing 240-365 days per year.
   COMMON NAMES Australian blackwood. FURTHER INF In Australia, the tree
   can be found at latitudes within 34-43°S, at altitudes between sea
   level and 2700 m. Generally the latitudinal range is 17-42°S.
   Australian blackwood is found on topography that varies from lowland
   swampy areas and the lower valley slopes of hilly and mountainous
   areas, to higher hill slopes and tablelands and even exposed mountain
   tops. The tree is termite resistant, tolerant of shade in youth, it
   fixes nitrogen and tolerates salt winds. Optimum annual wood production
   is 5-12 m3/ha. The tree has become a weed in South Africa and in New
   Zealand.
