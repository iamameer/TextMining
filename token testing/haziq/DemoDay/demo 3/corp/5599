   20ˆ60 cm long 10ˆ25 mm wide. Panicles mostly 15ˆ25 mm long, dense, the
   short, thick branches ascending. USE: Permanent grazing, silage and hay

   USA in North to Argentina in south and has naturalized in tropical and
   southern Africa, tropical Asia, Hawaii and northern Australia. Native
   to swamps, lake shores and wet-lands in water up 2-3 m deep for short
   periods but normally to 1 m. Grows best in wet or seasonally flooded
   areas, where flooding can occur for 7ˆ12 months of the year. Tolerates
   a wide range of soil fertility, but best on soils of medium to high
   fertility. It is adapted to soil pH 4.0ˆ8.0 and has some resistance to
   sodicity. Very tolerant of poor drainage. No frost tolerance but often
   protected from overnight frosts by surrounding volume of water. DM
