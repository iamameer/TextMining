   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A multi-stemmed shrub or small tree usually reaching
   a height between 3-10 m but can reach higher on favourable sites. The
   crown may be pendulous and the flowers are usually orange or yellow.
   USES The wood can be used as fuel and for posts, and poles. The tree
   can be planted as an ornamental and it is a source of honey. It can be
   used for erosion control on suitable sites and for revegetation of
   mining areas. The leaves contain an essential oil that has medicinal
   properties. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Liniment tree.
   FURTHER INF Liniment tree occurs in northern Australia within the
   latitudinal range 10-19Â°S at elevations between sea level and 200 m. It
   can also be found in Papua New Guinea. It is mainly found on flat or
   undulating country, often on low lying flood plains near the coast and
   fringing watercourses and lagoons. Its suckering habit could be a
   problem on some sites.
