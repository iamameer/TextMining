   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen shrub or a small tree reaching 5-10 m
   in height, occasionally up to 18 m. Bark is grey to brownish-blackish,
   smooth to rough when old. Leaves narrowly oblong-elliptic, 2-10 cm x
   7-17 mm, grey-green to shiny dark green above, greyish or yellowish
   with a dense covering of silvery, golden or brown scales on the under
   surface. Fruit ovoid, thinly fleshy, about 10 x 8 mm tapering to a
   sharp tip, dark brown or black when mature. USE: The plants are much
   browsed on by livestock. The wood is used as timber and fuel. In Kenya
   root or bark decoction are used as remedy for malaria. The tree is
   planted for revegetation and as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD: Slow
   growing perennial tree, growing 120-270 days per year. COMMON NAMES:
   Brown olive, wild olive. FURTHER INF: It is widely distributed in its
   native range of southern Africa occurring in a variety of habitats,
   usually near water, on stream banks, in riverine fringes, but also in
   open woodland, among rocks and in mountain ravines. It is resistant to
   both frost and drought. Dry upland evergreen forest (edges, remnants)
   often associated with Juniperus; may be co dominant, also in woodland
   on lava flows.
