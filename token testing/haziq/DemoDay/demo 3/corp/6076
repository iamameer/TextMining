   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an erect herbaceous plant reaching 60-90 cm in
   height. It has a single main stem with branches, a short tap root and
   green-white flowers densely clustered in racemes at ends of short
   petioles from leaf axil. The seeds of buckwheat are actually entire
   fruits called achenes. USE: It is marketed as flour and used in food or
   as feed for livestock. Buckwheat has the same nutritive efficiency as
   proteins of animal origin. It may be fed whole to poultry. Buckwheat
   middling make satisfactory protein supplement for cattle and hogs. It
   is a good source of honey which is dark in colour and has a strong
   flavour. Buckwheat thrives on land of low productivity and produces a
   green manure crop in a short period of time. When ploughed under, the
   plant material decays rapidly making N and mineral constituents
   available for the succeeding crop. GROWING PERIOD Annual, growing 70-85
   days. COMMON NAMES Sibiriskt bovete (Sweden), Vill bokkveite (Norway),
   Tatarisk Boghvede (Denmark), Rikkatatar (Finland), Green Buckwheat,
   Tartary buckwheat, Indian wheat, Siberian buckwheat, Tartarian
   buckwheat (England), Falsche Buchweizen (Germany). FURTHER INF:
   Scientific synonym: Polygonum tataricum L. Tartary buckwheat is
   considered more hardy than common buckwheat. It is native of parts of
   Asia. It can become a weed of pastures or Fagopyrum esculentum fields.
