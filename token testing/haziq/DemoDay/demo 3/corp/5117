   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A small, bushy, irregular, deciduous thornless shrub or
   small tree reaching about 4-6 m in height and 3-4.5 m in width, with
   crowded gnarled branches and a low crooked habit. Young branchlets are
   covered with a pale greyish wool. Fruits are light golden-yellow, green
   or orange, usually pear shaped (but sometimes round and apple-shaped -
   sometimes classified as cv ŒMaliformis‚) and very fragrant. The fruit
   pulp is firm, aromatic and always contains gritty cells. Individual
   fruits can weight up to ∏ Kg or more, and ripen late in the autumn.
   Fruits contain seeds which are poisonous. USES: A gum is obtained from
   the seed coats and used as a laxative, and as an emulsifying and
   stabilizing agent in medical preparation and in cosmetics, and
   demulcent lotions. The fruit is used for preserves and jellies. KILLING
   T Quinces are generally hardy to -15 to -25°C, but have a low chilling
   requirement (much less than most apples) - 100 to 450 hours below 7°C
   in order to flower. GROWING PERIOD Slow-growing perennial. First
   harvest may be taken after 2 years and the tree has an economical life
   of 25 years. COMMON NAMES Quince, Coing, Membrillo, Quitte. FURTHER INF
   Quince is believed to be native of the region between Iran and northern
   India and Tibet. Humidity may be high during the winter when the tree
   is dormant, but should be medium to low during spring and summer.
