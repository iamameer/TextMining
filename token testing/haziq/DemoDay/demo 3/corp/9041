   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree reaching up to 30 m in height. USE:
   Elephant and kudu browse the leaves and the flowers are a source of
   honey. The heartwood makes high-quality furniture, as it is easily
   worked, glues and screws well and takes a fine polish. It shrinks very
   little when drying from the green condition, and this quality, together
   with its high durability, makes it particularly suitable for boat
   building, canoes and bathroom floors. The red gummy sap contains 77%
   tannin. Bark preparations are used to relieve stomach disorders,
   headaches, blood in the urine, earache and mouth ulcers. Root
   preparations are used as a cure for malaria, blackwater fever,
   diarrhoea, bilharzias, abdominal pains, asthma and tuberculosis. The
   tree is planted for erosion control and as an ornamental. It can fix
   atmospheric nitrogen. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: African
   teak, bloodwood, Rhodesian teak, sealing-wax tree, Transvaal teak, wild
   teak. FURTHER INF: It occurs in woodlands and sometimes as stunted
   trees in wooded grassland on mountain tops. In South Africa, it is
   usually found in the lowveld in woodland and bushveld in deep sandy
   soil and sometimes on hillsides. It is regarded as an indicator of
   well-drained soils. It is sensitive to frost and is reputed to be fire
   tolerant, making it an important species for enrichment planting in
   areas where fire cannot be excluded completely. Adaptable to red loams
   and deep sandy soils, but not coastal sands or black clays. Prefers
   soils whose physical characteristic permit water to rapidly drain down
   the soil profile, at least through the top 30 cm.
