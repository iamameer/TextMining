   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree reaching 15-30 m in height. The
   bark is greyish-white or silver mottled and smooth in young trees,
   turning rough, flaky, creamy, light grey, dark brown or black in older
   trees. USE: The fruit is edible. Flowers provide good bee forage. Fruit
   is used as a remedy for dysentery, while a decoction of the bark is
   used as an antidiarrhoeic. In traditional medicine, liquid from the
   pounded bark and roots, mixed with water, is used as a purgative. The
   poisonous bark has been reported to cause human deaths. Wood is used as
   firewood and charcoal. The handsome evergreen tree is preserved in
   gardens for its deep shade. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES:
   snake bean tree, water berry (English). FURTHER INF: It usually occurs
   in lowland rain forests, mountain rain forests, fringing riverian
   swampy forests and open woodland. It usually grows in moist conditions,
   sometimes even in water, and is usually found along streams and wadis
   and on rocky ground in high rainfall savannah. It prefers fresh, moist,
   well-drained soils with a high water table.
