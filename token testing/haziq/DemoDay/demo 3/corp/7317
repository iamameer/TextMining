   Ecocrop code 7317

   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: A herb, stems commonly erect or ascending reaching 10-30
   cm in height. USES: The seeds provide a high-quality fatty oil with the
   unique ability to cling to metal surfaces of gears and bearings while
   withstanding wide temperature variations and high pressure. This oil
   has potential as a substitute for sperm whale oil and for use in
   quality waxes, lubricants, detergents, and plasticizers. The expressed,
   defatted seed can be fed to goats, chickens, and sheep. GROWING PERIOD:
   Annual, normally sown in autumn and harvested in early summer. COMMON
   NAMES: White meadowfoam, Meadowfoam. FURTHER INF.: White meadowfoam is
   native of the Pacific coast in the United States. Commonly found on
   banks, gravelly bars of small intermittent streams in Sierra Nevada
   foothills, growing on porous, quick-drying soils, essentially a
   xerophyte, flowering and setting seed on the last seasonal soil and
   stem moisture. Has about the same water requirement as dry-farmed
   winter grains, and seems to require less moisture than other species of
   this genus. Seed yields may be about 1.137-1.177 kg/ha.
