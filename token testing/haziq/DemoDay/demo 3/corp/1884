   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: The sugar cane plant is a large perennial tropical grass
   with thick stems that may grow up to 2-3 meters tall, but with extended
   growing periods it can become much taller. The roots of the cane plant
   develop from the growth ring on the original planting piece and also
   from the new shoots that develop. The majority of the roots are thin
   and superficial with four fifths of the roots commonly found in the top
   25-50 cm. Thicker roots will penetrate to depths of four meters or
   more. The stem of sugarcane is economically the most important plant
   part. The stems are made up of nodal units, which include the node and
   the internode. The internal part of the stem is largely parenchyma
   interspersed with vascular bundles. The parenchyma cells accumulate
   sugar. Each node subtends a leaf with an axillary bud at the base of
   the leaf sheath. The individual shoots of sugarcane show strong apical
   dominance; however, when this is broken the axillary buds develop into
   new shoots. Contrary to most grasses, the stem is not hollow but
   filled, as in maize and sorghum. In a magnified cross section it
   presents the typical aspect of a monocotyledon. Inside the rind tissue
   and within the vascular bundle is the delicate parenchyma that contains
   the sucrose-rich plasma. The leaves of sugarcane are distributed
   alternately on the stem and comprise the leaf sheath and the leaf blade
   or lamina. The leaf sheath wraps closely round the stem and in some
   varieties clings to the stem long after the leaf blade and the sheath
   have senesced. On some varieties the sheath ruptures naturally where it
   joins the node and the leaves fall naturally. Leaves and sheaths of
   some varieties are covered with a large number of siliceous hairs.
   These hairs penetrate the skin of cane cutters and are most unpleasant;
   hence cane cutters prefer varieties with few hairs or burnt cane. The
   terminal meristem of the cane shoot turns reproductive about 3 months
   before the emergence of the flower. The flowers of cane are of no
   commercial significance per se, and many varietal selection programs
   are directed towards the elimination of flowering in commercial fields.
   Flowering is, however, of great importance in breeding programs, many
   of which use artificial methods to stimulate flowering. USES: It
   provides raw sugar. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter
   mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock
   feed, and for the manufacture of fiberboard, paper pulp, plastic,
   furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for
   industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of
   industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as
   fertilizer. Cane wax is used in the production of furniture, shoe, and
   leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper.
   Brazil is a major grower of sugarcane, which is used to produce sugar
   and provide the ethanol used in making gasoline-ethanol blends
   (gasohol) for transportation fuel. KILLING T.: Seedlings may not
   tolerate -7 to -12°C, and the mature plant not -2°C. Long-term exposure
   to temperatures below 10°C may also be lethal. When temperatures reach
   0°C leaves become chlorotic, at about -3°C young plants turn brown and
   the terminal buds and leaves of mature cane die, at -5.5°C the millable
   stem dies. When the temperature reaches -11.5°C the whole plant dies in
   susceptible clones. There are large varietal differences in cold
   tolerance and susceptibility to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial,
   growing from 7-24 months, usually 14-18 months, with an additional 12
   months for the ratoon crop. It is normally grown as a perennial crop in
   which several ratoons are taken. COMMON NAMES: Sugarcane, Nobel cane,
   Canne a sucre, Cana de azucar, Zuckerrohr. FURTHER INF.: For ripening
   relative low temperatures in the range of 10-20°C and dry weather are
   desirable. Sugarcane is photoperiod sensitive. Flowering is induced by
   a continuous reduction in day length of as little as 1 minute per day
   from long days of about 13 hours. Most commercial sugarcane is grown
   between 35°N and S in the tropics usually at altitudes from sea level
   to 1600 m. Nobel canes are native to islands in the South Pacific, most
   probably New Guinea. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III. Cane us is
   considered to be moderately tolerant to saline soil conditions;
   electrical conductivity of the soil solution should be less than 2 d S
   m-1 with a threshold value of 4 d S m-1. In Khuzestan, Iran, cane is
   grown on soils which have been desalinated from an EC of 30 to 3
   dS/m-1. Cane is relatively tolerant of acid soils with large areas of
   cane in Latin America grown on the acid oxisols and utisols. It prefers
   moderate to high humidity and high winds cause damage and lower yields.
   Where sugarcane is grown under irrigation in Africa, a yield of 100-150
   tons of cane/ha is obtained from the plant crop and 60-90 tons from the
   first ratoon crop. Under rain-fed conditions, about half of the above
   mentioned yield is obtained. Sugarcane is grown on over 20 million ha
   with an average yield of 64 t/ha to produce a total of 1,25 million t
   of cane. This is equivalent to about 130 million t of sugar if all the
   cane were used to produce sugar in moderately efficient factories.
   Centrifuged sugar production from cane is much less, as large
   quantities of cane are used to produce alcohol, particularly in Brazil
   as a liquid fuel.
