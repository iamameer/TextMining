   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A monocarpic herbaceous plant with a short thick stem
   and a close rosette of leaves 60-160 cm in length. The roots rarely go
   deeper than about 35 cm. Towards the end of its lifespan it produces a
   long stout flowering pole. USES The leaves yield a hard, coarse fiber
   used in the manifacture of twines, cordage, and sacks. The fiber cannot
   be spun as finely as jute and ropes tend to break suddenly. Fibers are
   also used to reinforce plaster boards and paper. The leaves contain
   hecogenin used in the partial synthesis of the drug cortisone. GROWING
   PERIOD Short-lived perennial, with a yearly growth cycle of 150-270
   days. Harvest can begin 2-4 years after planting, depending on
   temperature, and can continue up to about the 7-12th or even 20th year.
   At this stage the plant produce flowers and die. COMMON NAMES Sisal.
   FURTHER INF Sisal can in the tropics be grown at elevations up to 2000
   m. It prefer moderate humidity. The species is indigenous to Central
   America and Mexico. One ton of fibre removes about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 80
   kg K, 65 kg Ca and 40 kg Mg from the field. Because the fibres
   themselves contain few minerals, the majority of the nutrients can be
   returned to the land with the pulp. The average yield is about 0.9 t/ha
   of dried fibres, on the best plantations in East Africa, yearly yields
   of 2.0-2.5 t/ha of dried fibres are obtained. Mentioned as a useful
   agroforestry species.
