   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A erect, evergreen tree, typically 10-14 m tall,
   although in favorable localities it may reach 30 m. In Israel it has
   been recorded to reach 20 m within 12-14 years. The stem is moderately
   straight up to 60-75 cm in diameter and typically dominant for most of
   the tree's height. USES The wood can be used as roofing shingles,
   fences, staves, paneling, furniture, marine piling, and fuel. The tree
   is utilized for erosion control and for plantings in saline and swampy
   soils. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial. COMMON NAMES Swamp
   she-oak, Muinji, Longleaf ironwood, Longleaf casuarina, Marsh she-oak,
   Swamp she-oak, Grey buloke, Mvinje, Savuku. FURTHER INF Scientific
   synonym: C. lepidophloia. Swamp she-oak is native of south eastern
   Australia, where it is found near the sea at latitudes between
   25-36.5Â°S. In Hawaii, it can be found at elevations between sea level
   and 900 m, but it is usually found near sea level. The tree is well
   adapted to tropical coast climates. It is drought hardy, tolerates salt
   winds and fixes nitrogen. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species.
   Because it regenerates vigorously from root sprouts, the tree is a
   possible weed, and has become a pest in southern Florida and is
   regarded as noxious in Hawaii. Photosynthesis pathway C3. Annual wood
   production potential is 10-12 m3/ha.
