   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a tree reaching up to 35 m in height with a dbh of
   85 cm under favourable conditions. It has a fluted and often curved
   bole, which makes it difficult to obtain large dimensions of timber.
   Bark grey, smooth or rough with longitudinal cracks. USE: The timber is
   used in flooring, furniture and joinery. In Kenya, it is a favourite
   wood for carving artefacts. Wood also used as firewood and charcoal.
   Oil distilled from the wood has a pleasant, vetiver-like perfume. Bees
   collect and feed on pollen from the flowers. It is planted as an
   ornamental tree around dwellings in Kenya. In northern Tanzanian, the
   tree is overexploited because of its value as fence posts. GROWING
   PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: silver oak. FURTHER INF: In Kenya, it
   is common in semi-deciduous tropical forests of the central highlands
   and the lowland dry coastal belts. It is also found in the northern
   forests of Tanzania. It prefers deep, well developed, red, volcanic
   clay loams in plateau forests and red soils in the coastal belts.
