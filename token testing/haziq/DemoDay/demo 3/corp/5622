   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A herb reaching 30-60 cm in height, floating free or
   rooting in the mud of shallow waters with broadly ovate or rhomboid
   leaves and inflorescences with 5-35 flowers. USES It can be used as
   green manure, compost and mulch for soil improvement. It can also be
   used as a vegetable, as animal forage, to camoflage fish traps, in the
   production of paper and it can be made into biogas. It is also grown as
   an ornamental. KILLING TEMP The leaves are killed by freezing
   temperetures but entire plants are not killed until the rhizomes are
   frozen. GROWING PERIOD Perennial. Under favourable conditions the
   growth is very rapid and the area under plant cover may double within a
   period of 6-15 days. COMMON NAMES Water hyacinth, Jacinthe d'eau,
   Kehpuk, Eceng gondok, Lengak, Kemeling telur, Keladi brunting, Bunga
   jamban, Water lily, Beda-bin, Yepadauk, Kamplaok, Tob poongz, Phal top
   chawa, Luc-binh. FURTHER INF Water hyacinth is native of tropical
   regions in South America. It has been introduced many places as an
   ornamental and has become a troublesome weed because of its rapid
   growth and formation of dense, impenetrable mats which hinder
   navigation and fishing, obstruct irrigation and drainage of farm lands
   and crowd out other plants. Its present latitudinal range is between
   38Â°N and S. It thrives in a variety of fresh water habitats, from
   shallow ponds, marshes, and small streams to large lakes and rivers.
   However, strong wave movements may reduce growth.
