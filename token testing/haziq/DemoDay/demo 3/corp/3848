   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: An erect annual vegetable 0,9-1,2 m tall at flowering, but
   known to achieve 1,8 m. It has a deep root system. The stems are
   reddish-green, often profusely branched with lateral buds. Leaves are
   alternate, non-heading with long petioles. The foliage is light green
   with purplish veins, often light brown glabrous or bearing a few hairs
   on the ribs. Flowers are usually light yellow about 1,5 cm across, on
   short pedicels on an extended raceme. Flowers are regular with four
   free sepals in one series and two sets of stamens. The fruit is a
   silique, usually less than 5 cm long, stout and broad with carinate
   angles, usually dehiscent. The seed is large and predominantly dark,
   small, often globular, 0,2 cm thick, filled with embryo. Although,
   there are yellow-seeded forms and B. carinata is being investigated as
   a source of large yellow seeds. The weight of 1000 seeds is
   approximately 3.5 grams. USES: In Ethiopia the plant is used mainly for
   its tender leaves and sprouts, which are boiled and eaten especially
   during periods of fasting, which are numerous among the Coptic people.
   The cooked vegetable accompanies a starchy staple like maize or cassava
   meal, banana or potatoes. The name of mustard comes from the use of
   seed in condiments. Seeds are used for oil. The oil finds wide
   application in the production of water repellents, waxes, polyesters
   and lubricants. Seed cake remaining after extraction of oil can be used
   as fertilizer or feed stuff. It is also used as a green fodder crop,
   green manure and as a cover crop. Interest in this species for
   industrial uses has been increasing thanks to the particular acid
   composition of its extracted oil. The seed oil is used to produce
   bio-diesel or special erucic acid derivatives. KILLING T.: 0^oC at
   early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. The main phenological stages
   are:- germination: 5-6 days after sowing - emergence to first
   flowering: 156 days - first flowering to maturity: 69 days. COMMON
   NAMES: Abyssinian cabbage (former USSR), Abyssinian mustard, Ethiopian
   mustard, Ethiopian rapeseed (Europe, trade mark name), Figiri (East
   Africa), gomenzer, Loshuu (Tanzania), Sukuma wiki (Kiswahili),
   Tamu-Texsel (Texas). FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: Brassica
   integrifolia var. carinata (West) Rupr, Melanosinapis abyssinica Hort.
   ex Regel, Sinapis abyssinica A.Braun. The plant has a wide growing
   range from the UK to North Africa; it is hardy and well adapted to the
   temperate climatic zones of Europe. The crop is still at an
   experimental stage. Current work on the crop suggests it may be most
   suited to semi-arid climates with mild or hot temperatures. Canadian
   trials suggest it can out-yield the best Brassica napus cultivars in
   these kinds of environments. The consensus is that the crop could be
   developed for use in drier areas where Brassica napus is less well
   adapted; this may include the Mediterranean basin. Developing the crop
   for use in these areas would allow oilseed production over a greater
   climatic range. s both heat and drought tolerant but not very resistant
   to frost; as such best results are achieved by sowing in autumn in
   Mediterranean areas, whereas in cooler areas (Northern Europe) it is
   best sown from spring onwards. Sowing date has been found to have a
   much larger effect on yield than seed rates and, where environments
   allow, an early autumn sowing is likely to achieve best results.
   Average yields have ranged from 2t/ha up to 3t/ha in Canada.
