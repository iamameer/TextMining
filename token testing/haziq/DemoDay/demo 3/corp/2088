   DESCRIPTION: It is a woody herb or succulent (scandent) shrub reaching
   1.2-3 m in height. Leaves opposite or alternate 3-5 lobed. Florets
   yellow, rays 3-6 cm x 5-18 mm. Heads solitary on a peduncle 6-13 cm
   long. Each mature stem may bear several flowers at the top of the
   branches. USE: It is a suitable species for fodder for cows and goats.
   The wood is used as fuel. An infusion of leaves is used as a medicine
   for constipation, stomach pains, indigestion, sore throat and liver
   pains. The leaves should be ground into small pieces, mixed with water,
   and then drunk. It is used for soil improvement and has a positive
   effect on crop yields. Yields of maize, kale, French beans, tomatoes
   and Napier grass all increased when these crops were planted with T.
   diversifolia. Also planted as living fence and as an ornamental.
   GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Mexican sunflower, tithonia.
   FURTHER INF: Found in hedges, along roadsides and field boundaries and
   on wasteland. In Kenya it is found in Western and Central Provinces as
   well as in coastal regions and parts of the Rift Valley. It is
   moderately resistant to drought.
