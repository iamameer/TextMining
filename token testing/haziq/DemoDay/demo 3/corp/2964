   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A semideciduous shrub 1-2 m on unfavourable sites or
   a small tree reaching 4-15 m in height on better sites. The tree
   develops straight trunk and a spreading crown. USES It can be used for
   rehabilitation of sand dunes, for soil protection and shelter belts,
   and as a shade tree. The leaves are browsed by cattle and the tree can
   be used as an ornamental. GROWING PERIOD Fast-growing perennial. COMMON
   NAMES Crested wattle, Spiked acacia, Stinkbean, Brush wattle. FURTHER
   INF Scientific synonym: Paraserianthes lophantha. Crested wattle occurs
   in southeast Australia within the latitudinal range 31-31Â°S at
   elevations between sea level and 300 m. It also occurs in New Zealand,
   South Africa, and South America. It is mainly found on plateaux, hills,
   low ranges, and undulating to low hilly country. It thrives along river
   and stream banks and around swampy areas. The tree is moderately
   drought-resistant and nitrogen-fixing. It is a potential weed on moist,
   fertile valley sites. The tree is killed by fire.
