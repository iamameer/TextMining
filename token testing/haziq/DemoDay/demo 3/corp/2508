   m. Young leaves are often shiny with a bronze-violet color. Berries are
   borne in heavy clusters, they have a flattened form. USES The beans are
   roasted for a limited fresh ground coffee market. The bark can be made
   into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch. The pulp can be fed to cattle.
   It is mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD
   Perennial. It may tolerate 21-30 days of mild drought. COMMON NAMES
   Coffee excelsa, Kafeng barako. FURTHER INF Scientific synonym: C.
   liberica excelsa. Excelsa coffee originated in the Lake Chad area. It
   is recommended for altitudes between sea level and 750 m. With to much
   rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and
   fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform
   flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It
   will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Well managed
   plantations may yield up to 1.2 t/ha.
