   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: Dark green, very ornamental large leaves on an herbaceous,
   semi-hardy plant that grows about 90-200 cm tall and upright, with
   slightly less spread than height. Leaves can be quite large, with deep
   cuts, although there's quite a bit of difference among individual
   leaves. In summer, makes creamy white to slightly pink or purplish
   flowers on dramatically tall, erect stalks above foliage, although the
   plant's main drama is its foliage. USE: It is a fine foliage plants for
   the shrub border, but should be used with caution for it can easily
   become a pest - though admittedly a handsome and classical one. Since
   the explosive pods scatter seed over a wide area and it will regrow
   from any scrap of root, the plant is hard to eradicate. FURTHER INF:
   Native to Mediterranean region.
