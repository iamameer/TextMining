   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a shrub or a small drooping tree to over 3 m tall.
   The leaves are in groups of three, tapering at both ends and widest in
   the middle, about 1-3 cm long and greyish-green in colour. There are
   fine silky hairs on the underside of the leaves, along the stems and
   around the base of the flowers. The flowers are white and shaped like
   pea flowers. The seed pod is 4-5 cm long. USE: It is a highly valued
   fodder bush from which heavy yields can be obtained year after year.
   Animals accustomed to grazing on it consume even the thick stems, so
   that the shrubs are eaten back to a compact base very quickly. The
   green leaves can also be lopped for poultry. Also grown as an
   ornamental. In areas of Australia it has become a weed. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial, needs to grow 2-3 years before first harvest or grazing, can
   live 20-30 years on fertile soils. COMMON NAMES: Tagasaste, Tree
   lucern. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonyms: Chamaecytisus palmensis,
   Cytisus prolifer. It is native to the Canary Islands and the
   mediterranean and is drought resistant but prefers moderate humid
   contitions and grows in sandy soils. Yields in Western Australia are
   about 1.8 t/ha on commercial farms and around 90 kg/tree/year, of which
   about 27% is dry matter.
