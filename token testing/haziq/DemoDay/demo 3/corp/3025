   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A medium to tall deciduous tree reaching a height of
   10-40 m and a trunk diameter of 30-100 cm. The narrow, conical crown
   has drooping branches. USES The wood can be used as pulpwood, for
   furniture, plywood, woodenware, paneling, fixtures, tool handles, as
   firewood, and charcoal. It can be planted as an ornamental, for
   windbreak, and on coal mine spoils. It is mentioned as a possible
   agroforestry species. KILLING T The tree may tolerate -34°C. GROWING
   PERIOD Perennial. COMMON NAMES Red alder, Oregon alder, Erle, Aune,
   Pacific coast alder, Western alder, Aune de l'Oregon. FURTHER INF
   Scientific synonym: A. oregana. Red alder is indigenous to a low
   elevation coastal zone of northwestern North America from Alaska to
   California. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of
   30-60°N and can be found at elevations between sea level and 1000 m.
   Pure stands are mainly found in stream bottoms, on moist flats, along
   rivers, in swamps, and on lower slopes. Optimum annual production is 11
   m3/ha for the 20-30 year rotations needed to produce pulpwood and small
   sawlogs, or 21 m3/ha for a short coppice rotation for firewood. Because
   of its aggressiveness and vigor, the red alder can invade plantations
   of slower growing trees, overtop them, and become a serious pest. The
   tree fixes nitrogen and it regenerates rapidly.
