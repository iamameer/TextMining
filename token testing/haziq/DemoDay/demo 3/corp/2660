   Notes
   BRIEF DESCRIPTION A large evergreen shrub or small tree, usually
   reaching 6-10 m but at times attaining 15-25 m in height with a trunk
   to 50 cm in diameter and a spreading rounded crown. Open-grown
   specimens are freely-branched from near the ground level and often have
   a crooked trunk, when growing in forest formations it usually have a
   straight stem. USES The wood is hard but moderately easy to work and
   takes a good polish. It is used for house poles, mine timber, tool
   handles, cabinetwork, joinery, flooring, construction timber,
   matchwood, hardboard, and paper pulp. It is an excellent fuelwood and
   charcoal. The bark is rich in tanning. It can be used to controlsoil
   erosion on steep slopes, to improve soil fertility, for shelter and
   firebelts, and for ornamental purposes. KILLING T Moterately frost
   tolerant. GROWING PERIOD Perennial tree, that can provide bark after
   5-10 years. Withstands a drought period of 2-3 months and frosts of
   20-40 days. COMMON NAMES Black wattle, Acacia negra, Acacia noir,
   Schwarze akazie, Gomboom, Tan wattle. FURTHER INF Scientific synonyms:
   A. mollissima, A. decurrens. In southeastern Australia, the tree can be
   found at latitudes within 33-44Â°S. Near Equator, it can be found at
   altitudes between 1000-2800 m, and in the subtropics, the tree can
   found between sea level and 2500 m. It is drought hardy, fixes
   nitrogen, tolerates salt winds and regenerates rapidly. The species is
   indigenous to southeasten Australia and Tasmania. Black wattle occurs
   on gentle to moderately hilly topography and in the southern hemisphere
   it prefers easterly and southerly aspects. Mentioned as a possible
   agroforestry species. Optimum annual wood production is 10-35 m3/ha,
   and optimum bark yield is 1.5-4 t/ha. In Hawaii, it has become a
   noxious weed at elevations between 600-1200 m, specially in the
   1000-1200 mm rainfall zones. In South Africa, it has been called "green
   cancer" because it is spreading out of control and the tree has also
   become a weed in Hawaii, Chile and Kenya.
