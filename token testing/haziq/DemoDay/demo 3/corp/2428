   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a deciduous tree growing to 40 m in height and 3 m
   in girth, with the branches arranged in whorls and spreading
   horizontally. Leaves crowded at the ends of branchlets, digitate, with
   7-9 leaflets. USE: The seeds have a pleasant taste and are sometimes
   eaten. Edible oils are obtainable from the seed. Leafs and seed are
   used as fodder. The wood is used as timber. Leaves and bark have
   considerable medicinal value; in Ghana, seeds are taken as a purgative.
   Oil from the seed is extracted on a local scale to be used in medicine.
   Cord is made from the bark fibre. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON
   NAMES: bastard poon tree, hazel sterculia, wild almond tree. FURTHER
   INF: It shows good adaptability to soil, but probably needs soils with
   sufficient moisture for optimum development. It demands light and needs
   a lot of space for proper development.
