   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen tree 6-21 m, with a rounded to
   spreading and dense crown. Sometimes epiphytic, often a strangler,
   trunk fluted or multistemmed. Bark smooth and grey on older branches
   and stems, lenticellate, often with aerial roots hanging down from
   branches. Leaves simple, glossy, dark green, 3-20 x 1.5-10 cm. Figs
   7-14 mm in diameter. USE: A good jam can be made from the ripe fruits.
   Figs and especially leaves can be used as fodder. Wood is used as fuel,
   latex and fibre are extracted from the bark. The bark is important in
   local medicine, and it is used in treating colds, sore throat,
   dysentery, wounds, constipation, nosebleed and to stimulate lactation.
   Latex is used for wound fever, while an infusion of the root and fibre
   is taken orally to help prevent abortion. Powdered root is taken in
   porridge to stop nosebleed; the milky latex is dropped into the eye to
   treat cataracts. It is planted for erosion control, shelter and as an
   ornamental. This tree has an aggressive root system and should not be
   planted in a small garden or near buildings, swimming pools or paths.
   It makes an ideal shade tree in a large garden or park, and it makes a
   successful container plant for the patio. It is also ideal for use as a
   bonsai specimen. In Uganda, the tree is intercropped with coffee and
   bananas. Leaf litter helps in the improvement of the nutrient status
   and water-holding capacity of the soil. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial.
   COMMON NAMES: strangler fig. FURTHER INF: It is widely distributed in
   upland forest, open grassland, riverine and rocky areas and sometimes
   in savannah. Trees are relatively drought resistant. It occurs on a
   wide variety of soils but favours light, deep and well-drained soils
   with neutral to acidic reaction and humus-rich or deep loamy soil.
