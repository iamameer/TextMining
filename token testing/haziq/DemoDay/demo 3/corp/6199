   Notes
   DESCRIPTION: It is a semi-deciduous spreading savannah tree, usually
   reaching 18-22 m but can become up to 45 m, occasionally buttressed.
   Bark on older stems, grey-green, fairly smooth, with scattered grey
   scales and pale brown patches where scales have fallen off. Leaves
   broadly ovate or elliptic, 2.5-21 x 2-16 cm. Fig up to 3.5 x 5 cm. USE:
   Fruits and leaves are edible and also used as fodder. Wood is used as
   timber and as firewood and charcoal. Inner part of the root used as
   weaving fibre, and a strong rope can be made from the inner bark. The
   bark is used for the treatment of scrofula, coughs, and throat and
   chest diseases. The milky latex is used for treatment of dysentery and
   chest diseases, or is applied to inflamed areas, while ringworm is
   treated with the bark and milky latex. Leaves are said to be effective
   against jaundice and as an antidote for snakebite, while the roots have
   laxative and anthelmintic properties. It can be used for sand-dune
   fixation and riverbank stabilization, shade in market places and as an
   ornamental. Shed leaves form a valuable litter improving the nutrient
   status, infiltration rate and water-holding capacity of the soil.
   Usually intercropped with bananas as an understorey. GROWING PERIOD:
   Perennial. COMMON NAMES: sycamore fig, wild fig. FURTHER INF: A common
   savannah tree that grows in high water table areas. Often found along
   watercourses such as streams and rivers, swamps and waterholes. It is
   sensitive to frost but can withstand some cold. It is found in
   afro-mountain forests, especially along edges and in clearings,
   riverine forests, riparian woodland, secondary evergreen bushland.
   Often left as single trees in farmland and occasionally seen as single
   trees on rocky outcrops. Prefers deep, well-drained loam to clay soil
   rich in nutrients. Sandy soils with a shallow groundwater level may
   also be suitable.
